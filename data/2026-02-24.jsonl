In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling."}

These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\\leq$1 MK is $\\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos."}

Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the \"streaming limit.\" Downstream, a spatially-uniform \"reservoir\" of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements.

In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae.

We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\\sim3000\\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $>20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($>1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed."}

We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity."}

Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources."}

Gardner", "Antonio Napolitano"], "title": "Solar cycle irregularity study", "comment": "3 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo."}

Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

M. Scaife"], "title": "Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $β$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($β= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $β$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $β$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys."}

This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($ε_\\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \\simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \\ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \\lesssim 0.01\\,M_\\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \\sim 0.1\\,M_\\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $ε_\\star \\approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \\simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation."}

Version accepted in MNRAS", "summary": "Tidal disruption events which repeat on timescales of months-to-years represent an unambiguous signature of a partial disruption, with the surviving stellar remnant returning to pericentre to be repeatedly stripped by tidal forces. These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\\rm edd} = L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm edd} \\sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 0.1-1$ hr)."}

However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection."}

This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $Λ$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m = 0.3035 \\pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \\pm 0.0059$, and $σ_8 = 0.822 \\pm 0.034$.

The main benefits of the Band-4 WVR concept are: (1) sensing water vapor in a region more representative of the Band 5 \\& 6 science beams in the lower layers of the troposphere, in the near-field of the 18 m antenna, than the 1.5 m antenna (2) significantly relaxing the stability requirements due to the lower receiver temperature of the standard Band-4 cryogenic receiver and (3) eliminating the procurement, deployment, and maintenance of a large number of standalone units. Given these advantages, it is recommended that the details and the pros and cons of Band-4 WVR implementation compared a standalone system be carefully considered."}

The maximum decrease amplitudes of these events are about 30% - 15%, and the amplitudes reduce with energy. The recovery time of these events shows diverse behaviors of their energy-dependence. Some of them show strong energy-dependence, while some have a nearly constant recovery time.

However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves >95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems."}

The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $χ^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $Λ$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $α$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration."}

We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 < z < 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 < z < 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 < z < 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z > 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift."}

To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/dν to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core."}

A total of 39 bursts were detected, allowing for a detailed search for burst oscillations, which had not been previously observed from this source. We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 447.7$-$448.0 Hz from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, consistent with the spin frequency of the NS.

This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances."}

Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $β$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction.

Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems.

A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $Δx \\simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution.\n  A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\\ln(1+z)$.\n  While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe."}

Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or \"safety\" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here."}

The dominant jet PA wobble yields Pjet = 7.20 +/- 0.05 h. An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution. The jet structure precesses about the rotation axis with a characteristic angular excursion of order about 20 degs, and the rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within about 20 degs."}

Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset."}

The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $η$ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \\times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \\times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $η$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \\times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $η$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $η= 8.65 \\times 10^{-11}$.

Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems."}

We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures."}

Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process\". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\\sim4~{\\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales."}

I identify 8565 grazing double transits, 49 partial-overlap double transits (both moons simultaneously on the solar disc, with at least one partially cut off by the limb), and 17 full double transits in which both moons lie wholly within the solar disc at the same moment. All events cluster tightly around the Martian equinoxes (Ls ~ 0 deg or 180 deg) and within +/- 9 deg of the equator, reflecting the near-equatorial orbital inclinations of both moons. I derive a hard theoretical latitude limit of +/- 13.1 deg beyond which simultaneous double transits are geometrically impossible. The next observable partial double transit, excluding less prominent grazing events, is predicted for 2034 April 17. The next full double transit, with both moons wholly inside the solar disc, with a gap between each silhouette and the solar limb, occurs on 2118 November 20. The geometries for both these events were confirmed with JPL Horizons. I provide uncertainty estimates based on the Brozovic et al. covariance model, with predicted position errors growing from ~1 km for near-term events to ~600 km at the catalogue boundaries, and note that the JAXA MMX mission (~2031) will dramatically reduce uncertainties for all post-2030 predictions."}

Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay Δt between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and Δt. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN > 0.5 and RN > 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN > 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN > 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds. The results provide direct observational confirmation that magnetic loop geometry plays a key role in governing the temporal evolution of energy transport in solar flares."}

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs."}

We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium."}

In the southwestern region, the forward shock is thought to have reached the cavity wall, encountering diverse environmental conditions. We report on the spatially resolved X-ray polarimetric observation of RCW 86 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In the 2--4.5 keV energy band we find no significant detection of polarization. Employing a dedicated background subtraction procedure and Bayesian spectropolarimetric fitting, we derive 99% upper limits on the polarization degree of the synchrotron component: 15% in higher-statistics regions and 30%--40% in lower-statistics regions. These upper limits on the polarization degree in several regions exclude the possibility of a strongly coherent magnetic field down to the subparsec scale, and that of a moderately coherent one on the scale of the synchrotron features as resolved by IXPE. The results indicate that the shocks in the southwestern rim of RCW 86 propagate more slowly than the unshocked ejecta at their locations, yet exceed the measured proper motion speeds. This behavior is consistent with reflected shocks occurring in tenuous regions of the shocked ejecta, distinct from regions that are radio-bright."}

Earlier studies had suggested that the obliquity distribution is bimodal, with peaks corresponding to aligned orbits and polar orbits; the addition of more measurements has weakened the evidence for bimodality. The current sample appears to be consistent with a population of well-aligned systems and a smaller population with nearly random obliquities. This distribution resembles that observed for more massive planets, suggesting that transiting Jupiters and Neptunes originate from similar dynamical processes."}

In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere.

The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance."}

The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship."}

However, systematic surveys targeting metre- to decametre-sized bodies are rare, thus leaving their spin distribution poorly constrained. Our aim was to quantify the prevalence of fast rotation and characterise the spin-rate distribution of small NEAs to constrain their internal strength and evolution. We conducted a dedicated high-cadence photometric survey of 249 NEAs using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT). Rotation periods and amplitudes were derived from dense time series to classify objects as fast or non-fast rotators. We determined the rotation period of 156 new fast rotators (P < 2.2 h), including 87 that rotate faster than 10 min. The prevalence of fast rotators increases with absolute magnitude: from 60.6-80.3 % for 22 < H < 24 to 77.3-89.4 % for 24 < H < 26 and 94.1-96.1 % for H > 26, indicating that fast rotation dominates in the small NEA population. Most objects spin faster than the gravity-defined limit; 98 targets require cohesive strengths exceeding that of weak rubble piles, and 22 are compatible only with compact, high-strength interiors. This is the first systematic survey targeting the rotation of such small NEAs, providing the largest homogeneous sample of fast rotators obtained by a single campaign. Our findings demonstrate that fast rotation is the norm for objects smaller than tens of metres, implying that modest cohesive strength is required to prevent their rotational disruption."}

Some light curves show signs of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs), which may encode clues regarding the physical processes behind the emission or point to supermassive binary black holes. We analyzed five blazars with previously reported high significance year-long QPOs, applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform methods to Fermi-LAT data up to early 2025. We furthermore examined an additional source (PKS 0139-09), where nascent QPO may be present. As the light curves showed longer term trends, we detrended the data using an STL decomposition, which often revealed a large seasonal component. We find that detrending generally leads to an increase in the strength of the QPO signal. However, except for PG 1553+113, where a clearly persistent QPO signal is present, we detect transience on a timescale of $\\lesssim$4000 days. We then forecast the light curves over the following four years, using a traditional statistical method as well as a Transformer-based deep learning model. Applied to a test set, the latter showed significant success in predicting behavior that seems unexpected from simple inspection of the past data. Analyzing the extended time series suggests a markedly weaker QPO signals over the coming years in cases where the transient behavior appears near the end of the observational data. In contrast, in the nascent candidate QPO source (PKS 0139-09) the signal is expected to strengthen significantly. These predictions, which may reflect the physical origin of the QPOs, can be tested against future data."}

Article accepted for publication in Annales Geophysicae", "summary": "We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models."}

No statistically significant evidence for defects is found, although we observe a mild preference for non-zero cosmic string tension.

Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature.

Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep.

FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values.

By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $δ$, $B$, $p$, $γ_{\\rm min}$ and $γ_{\\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $δ$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $δ$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $δ$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models.

Its widespread presence poleward of 60° latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68°N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35° latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35° obliquity (40°), at latitudes of 40-55°N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago. We therefore infer that the mid-latitude subsurface ice is younger than 4 Myr."}

This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $δ$, $B$, $p$, $γ_{\\rm min}$ and $γ_{\\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $δ$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $δ$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $δ$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars."}

For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy."}

However, the most energetic bursts are rare, requiring a large sample of FRBs to detect them. In this work, we use the largest available such sample, 2,998 one-off FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog, to obtain a lower limit on the maximum energy ($E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$) of FRBs, assuming isotropic energy distribution from FRB sources. In the absence of known redshifts ($z$) for most sources, we present a framework that uses the dispersion measures (DMs) and fluences of these FRBs, together with the probability distribution of $z$ given DM, to derive the lower limit on $E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$. We generate simulated FRB samples assuming different parameter values for a log-normal $\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{host}}$ distribution and a Schechter function form of the FRB energy function to estimate how many outliers -- FRBs with large DM contributions from the host galaxy or intervening galaxy halos -- could artificially inflate this limit. After accounting for outliers, the lower limit on $E^{\\mathrm{max}}_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ from Catalog 2 FRBs ranges between $1.2\\times10^{41}$ and $1.9\\times10^{42}$ erg, with best estimate $1.2\\times10^{42}$ erg. This limit is consistent with those derived from much smaller FRB samples. Moreover, inferred energies of hundreds of FRBs appear collectively limited around $\\sim10^{42}$ erg, suggesting a physical limit on the energy reservoir of FRB sources. The corresponding isotropic-equivalent FRB source energy is consistent with the total energy available in a magnetar's external dipole magnetic field, supporting magnetars as FRB progenitors."}

We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion.

In this work, we present the first detailed investigation of Justitia's surface dynamics using the newly developed 3-D polyhedral shape model with 574 vertices and 1,144 faces. We analyze its geopotential, surface acceleration, escape speeds, slopes, and equilibrium points, and we also search for planar symmetric periodic orbits using an equivalent ellipsoidal approximation. Our results indicate that the lowest geopotential values occur at the poles, which also correspond to regions of maximum surface acceleration. The global slope distribution suggests preferred zones of material accumulation or migration, offering clues to Justitia's long-term morphological evolution. Most slopes remain below $40^\\circ$, implying that loose particles may settle stably across large portions of the surface. We identify five equilibrium points consistent with Justitia's estimated density and slow rotational period. Two external points (E$_2$ and E$_4$) exhibit linear stability, and all equilibrium locations lie relatively far from the surface due to the body's slow spin. Additionally, we discover 28 new families of planar symmetric periodic orbits, then classify their topologies and determine their linear stability, providing a dynamical framework relevant to future spacecraft operations near Justitia. Finally, thermal modeling reveals how thermal inertia and heliocentric distance shape Justitia's temperature distribution. The south pole receives more insolation than the north pole, reaching minimum temperatures of about 102~K and 87~K, respectively. These combined dynamical and thermal results offer valuable insights for the EMA mission and for understanding slowly rotating small bodies."}

Future high-frequency surveys of the Galactic Centre (GC) region to be performed by the next-generation radio telescopes, such as the SKA, may discover pulsars that orbit around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the SMBH dwelling in our GC. In this paper, we present a realistic pulsar-SMBH timing model based on the post-Newtonian equations of motion of the pulsar. Considering the expected timing precision in the future, we take into account several next-to-leading order light propagation time delays in the timing model. For the first time, we include the effects of proper motion of Sgr A*, which were expected to break the spin measurement degeneracy. We forecast the measurement precision of various parameters of Sgr A*, and discuss the data analysis procedure in the presence of red noise, which can be strong if the pulsar is a normal pulsar. The realistic timing model constructed in this study will serve as a useful tool in future searching and timing of pulsar-SMBH systems in the GC."}

These asteroids form orbital groups, (i.e., asteroid families formed by collisions) and also spectral groups (taxonomies) with different chemical compositions, in particular carbonaceous (C-types) and silicate (S-types). In this paper, we extend the existing main-belt collisional model by finding the appropriate strength-versus-size dependence (also known as the scaling law) for these two groups. We used color indices and geometric albedos of 56 and 72 spectroscopically confirmed C- and S-types (control samples), along with statistical methods on 1 065 034 asteroids, to assign C-, S-, or other types. This allowed us to construct observed size-frequency distributions (SFDs) for several subpopulations constrained by either semimajor axis (inner, middle, outer) or taxonomy (C, S, other). Then we used a Monte Carlo collisional model to compute the long-term collisional evolution (4.5 billion years) and derive synthetic SFDs. Our best-fit scaling laws indicate that S-types must be weaker below approximately 0.2 km than C-types to explain the deficiency of asteroids in the inner part of the main belt near (and below) the observational limit. This may correspond to differences in chemical composition or material porosity. Future research will focus on the scaling laws of asteroids with rare or \"extreme\" taxonomies (e.g., V, M)."}

For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [α/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with Δv90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [α/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy. We further find that the velocity widths vs. stellar masses and mass-metallicity relations agree well with observations, while GEAR should be calibrated more carefully to reproduce the Δv90 vs. metallicity relation."}

However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors."}

We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity.

This radiation-driven structure is an unusual environment for observations of planet formation and differs greatly from the low-mass star-forming regions disks are most commonly observed in. Aided by a collection of visual and spectroscopic data available for this system, this paper aims to infer the possibility of embedded planets existing within the disk and how the system's environment may affect its disk morphology. Using data from the VLT's instruments XSHOOTER, ESPRESSO and - most prominently - SPHERE along with data from ALMA, we make a variety of measurements (geometric, photometric and otherwise) to characterise the observed disk features and attributes such as spiral arms and eccentricity. Mapping of the velocity components is also undertaken using the ALMA gas line data to characterise disk orientation and determine the likelihood that the system is experiencing a late-stage infall event. The disk is found to be eccentric when deprojected. Under the assumption that the formation of a planet is wholly responsible for the primary and secondary spiral arms, we find the mass of such a planet can range between 0.004 and 3 Jupiter masses. Measurement of the velocities associated with nearby globule cloud material returns reasonable velocities for a late-stage infall event. We estimate far-ultraviolet field strength at AT Pyx's location to be low in comparison to other surveyed disks. We also find that AT Pyx is possibly a binary system. AT Pyx is the first disk within a cometary globule to be spatially resolved, and is now the first such disk to be investigated to this extent. The work of this paper could potentially be a first step into the further study of disks in the moderate-FUV environment of the Gum Nebula and its globules."}

Here we present the first high resolution XRISM Resolve spectrum of NGC 4051, which was captured in a historically bright state for a 150 ks exposure. XRISM resolves two blue-shifted Fe K shell absorption troughs in the mean spectrum, which can be ascribed to H-like iron and arises from two outflow components with outflow velocities of 0.025c and 0.04c. A time dependent spectral analysis shows that the iron K absorption is variable on timescales of less than a day, increasing in velocity over the duration of the observation. The velocity changes may be explained either by the passage of two separate transiting absorbers, of different velocities, or by a single accelerating outflow of approximately constant column density. In the latter case, the wind acceleration is likely to be too large to be caused by radiation pressure and instead magnetic driving is favored to accelerate the wind up to 0.04c. The outflow can originate from an accretion disk wind, whose kinetic power is sub-Eddington in contrast to recent examples of winds from powerful, luminous quasars observed by XRISM."}

We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\\pm0.116 and 0.733\\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\\pm0.110 and 0.529\\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk.

The prominent dust ring at 95 au (B95) is detected at 9.1 mm for the first time, while the faint outer ring at 160 au is not revealed. Through non-parametric visibility modeling, we identified two new annular features: a plateau within 20-50 au across all wavelengths, and a shoulder exterior to the B95 ring at 0.87, 1.17 and 1.33 mm, consistent with signatures of planet-disk interaction. We find that the width of the B95 ring remains constant across wavelengths, suggesting that fragmentation dominates over radial diffusion or that unresolved substructure is present within the ring. Resolved spectral modeling yields two families of dust solutions that reproduce the observations equally well: compact grains or highly porous (90\\%) grains, with carbonaceous components dominated by refractory organics or amorphous carbon, respectively.

They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \\textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \\leq m/M \\leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis."}

CRs can dissociate the molecules on dust grains, producing reactive suprathermal species and radicals which facilitate the formation of large molecules. We add the radiolysis process and some relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $ζ\\lesssim 10^{-14}\\ \\rm s^{-1}$. The non-diffusive chemistry affects the simulation results at 16 K but not 77K, while the results are sensitive to the desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77 K.

Using the ``photoeccentric effect'' in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we first model the population using discrete planetary size bins (sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, and Jovians). We then develop a continuous mixture model with weights governed by a logistic sigmoid function of radius. We find that the warm-single population is best described by two components: a dominant low-eccentricity mode ( <e_low> = 0.070-0.068+0.026) and a secondary dynamically excited mode (<e_high> = 0.616-0.075+0.091). The fraction of planets belonging to this high-eccentricity component increases strongly with planet radius, characterized by a transition at a break radius of R_br = 9.8-1.1+1.4 R_e. This trend places warm sub-Saturns predominantly on the same low-eccentricity track as sub-Neptunes. In contrast, warm Jovians (8--16 R_e) are frequently eccentric, with 59+-13% of the population in the high eccentricity mode. We detect this bimodality at >4sigma, providing statistically significant evidence that warm gas giants are sculpted by two distinct pathways, or a single mechanism with subsequent eccentricity excitation. Finally, we identify a non-negligible tail of highly eccentric sub-Neptunes (1--4 R_e), which comprise 14.9-6.5+5.1% of the population, consistent with excitation by non-transiting external companions."}

We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}>50\\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \\gtrsim 10^{46}\\,{erg\\,s^{-1}}$).

In the tidally locked limit, the nightside's tendency to radiatively cool and potentially trap volatiles as permanent ice introduces a strong dependence of habitability on the planet's surface and atmospheric boundary conditions. We perform a suite of synchronously rotating experiments spanning a wide range of topographic and orographic realizations with different mean elevations and landmass distributions. Across a grid of $p_{\\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5$-$8~\\mathrm{bar}$ and $F_{\\star} = 1200$-$1700~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, we find that surface relief breaks the flow symmetry, replacing the circumpolar vortices with mechanically forced stationary waves. Steep orography produces standing Rossby gyres that strengthen the cross-terminator jet and align vertical uplift with the day--night boundary. These new circulation regimes enhance moisture transport, increasing the infrared optical depth and promoting additional nightside cloud formation, which produces a stronger cloud-greenhouse feedback and lower the critical fluxes required for global planetary deglaciation. Broad, elevated plateaus drive a similarly fragmented but slightly weaker circulation, yielding less effective moisture transport. These results show that the relief and spatial distribution of landmasses, parameters unconstrained for most exoplanets, can exert strong controls on the climatic bifurcations of tidally locked M-dwarf exoplanets."}

The dominant jet PA wobble yields Pjet = 7.20 +/- 0.05 h. An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution. The jet structure precesses about the rotation axis with a characteristic angular excursion of order about 20 degs, and the rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within about 20 degs."}

The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $χ^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $Λ$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $α$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration."}

Accurate measurements remain challenging due to the large required dynamic range of up to 10 stellar magnitudes driving up operational complexity and cost. We developed an all-sky camera system operating at up to 500 frames per second featuring a novel Detection Localised Auto-brightness Control. Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems."}

Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors", "comment": "24 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $Λ$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $Ω_m=0.2987\\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\\pm 0.35\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.766\\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\\pm 0.018$), which are $1\\%$, $40\\%$ and $50\\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $σ_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\\%$ ($20\\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\\%$ limits $M_ν<0.073\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_ν<0.090\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ in $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints."}

Accepted for publication in ApJS", "summary": "Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($δ>\\sim0^{\\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $γ$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $γ$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems."}

Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\\rm sh}/R_{\\rm sp} \\sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations."}

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs."}

M. Scaife"], "title": "Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $β$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($β= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $β$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $β$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys."}

The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance."}

It is also known for its rapid X-ray variability, on timescales of kilo-seconds and has a complex, multi component wind in both the soft X-ray and Fe K bands. Here we present the first high resolution XRISM Resolve spectrum of NGC 4051, which was captured in a historically bright state for a 150 ks exposure. XRISM resolves two blue-shifted Fe K shell absorption troughs in the mean spectrum, which can be ascribed to H-like iron and arises from two outflow components with outflow velocities of 0.025c and 0.04c. A time dependent spectral analysis shows that the iron K absorption is variable on timescales of less than a day, increasing in velocity over the duration of the observation. The velocity changes may be explained either by the passage of two separate transiting absorbers, of different velocities, or by a single accelerating outflow of approximately constant column density. In the latter case, the wind acceleration is likely to be too large to be caused by radiation pressure and instead magnetic driving is favored to accelerate the wind up to 0.04c. The outflow can originate from an accretion disk wind, whose kinetic power is sub-Eddington in contrast to recent examples of winds from powerful, luminous quasars observed by XRISM."}

This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \\textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \\textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \\textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\\sim13\\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \\textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc.

We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs."}
