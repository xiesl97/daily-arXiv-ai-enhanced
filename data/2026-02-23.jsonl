In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\\sim 9\\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts."}

We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties."}

While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\\tildeΛ(Λ_1,Λ_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|ΔΛ| \\gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\\ln B > 5$). We further identify a \"V-shape\" asymmetry in detectability, where \"softening\" transitions (decreasing $Λ$) are systematically easier to detect than \"stiffening\" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present \"stress tests\" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio."}

Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times.

None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime."}

The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year.

Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire. This association suggests that flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights may produce coupled bright-dark structures, providing a plausible mechanism for the generation of picoflare jets. Our results demonstrate Solar Orbiter's ability to resolve the dynamics of small-scale jets and place new constraints on their origin."}

Accepted for publication in AJ", "summary": "The measurement of exoplanet masses using the radial velocity (RV) technique is currently limited by stellar activity, which introduces quasiperiodic variability signals that must be modeled and removed to enhance the sensitivity of the RV measurements to exoplanet signals. Neural networks have previously been demonstrated effective in modeling stellar activity signals in HARPS-N solar data using white light cross correlation functions (CCFs). Building on this work, we train a neural network on six years of HARPS-N solar data with additional parameters commonly associated to stellar activity, including chromatic CCFs, line shape metrics, spectral activity indicators, total solar irradiance (TSI) light curves from SORCE and TSIS-1, and TSI time derivatives. Our results show that parameters such as the bisector inverse slope and Na D equivalent widths do not significantly improve the neural network's ability to predict activity-induced RV variations compared to using the white light CCFs alone. However, parameters such as unsigned magnetic flux, the TSI and its time derivative, S-index, H-alpha equivalent width, chromatic CCFs, contrast, and full width at half maximum do improve the neural network's ability to predict RV scatter. Our new model reduces the RV scatter in a held-out test set from 147.1 cm/s to 93.3 cm/s, consistent with supergranulation noise levels reported in previous studies. These results suggest that finding effective tracers for (super)granulation will be critical to train models capable of further mitigating RV jitter, and necessary for characterizing Earth analogues."}

It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses."}

This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations."}

We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$α$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems, the vast majority of which have more than a decade of eclipse timing measurements, analysing their global properties to determine which driving force is the likely origin of the observed ETVs. Long-term, high-speed photometry data obtained with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM have allowed us to track the evolution of the ETVs in these systems, and analyse any previously unseen trends. From this analysis, we find a clear difference in the level of observed ETVs past the fully convective boundary, where systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently showing high levels of variation. While some systems may be affected by the presence of an unknown planet, the results from this study strongly indicates that an Applegate- or Lanza-like mechanism is the most likely driving force for the timing variations seen in the majority of systems in this sample. However, as found in previous studies, the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are still not able to reproduce the large and rapid timing variations seen in the vast majority of systems, with the companion star to the WD unable to provide sufficient energy on these short timescales."}

In contrast with recent results from $JWST$ and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, our retrieval analysis prefers the presence of H$_2$O, and possibly CH$_4$, molecular features in emission. The broad-band continuum flux associated with the maximum-likelihood model is substantially higher than expected based on both the $\\sim670\\rm\\ K$ equilibrium temperature of GJ 436 b and previous results from low-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the loss of continuum information during the processing of high-resolution spectra makes our analysis effectively insensitive to the absolute continuum level of the planet, and that scaling the maximum-likelihood model to match the broad-band flux measured from low-resolution observations of GJ 436 b results in a detection of similar strength in cross-correlation. These results could be explained by a thermal inversion arising above a haze layer in the upper atmosphere of \\gjb.

If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected."}

In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012)."}

We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $χ$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength."}

This work presents the latest status of SB9 after two decades of development, detailing the statistical properties of SBs through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage. We performed a rigorous cross-match with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to update astrometric parameters and compare SB9 with the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) catalogue. Our methodology utilized positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation for identification. The final SB9 version updated by D. Pourbaix includes 4003 systems, including higher-order multiples: 152 triples, 71 quadruples, and 14 higher-order systems. Of these, 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers; 21 are too bright and six too faint for detection. Ten SB9 systems with periods exceeding 1180 days were spatially resolved by Gaia DR3. We identified a common sample of 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 considered highly reliable based on period and eccentricity differences under 10%. The limited overlap (20-30% of SB9) results from NSS selection cuts, brightness limits, and temporal baselines. This study highlights the complementary strengths of both catalogues and establishes a benchmark sample for binary star research. Finally, this work marks the transition of SB9 into SBX (The eXtended Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits), featuring a modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory access standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community."}

Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks."}

In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|Δv|$ >~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have $Δv$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--$Δv$ space.

For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes."}

Our modeling idea starts from an existing model, the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-Wülser (ATLCW) model for sunspots. The original model is then modified in density and temperature with a constant factor over all heights. A least-square fit in both density and temperature to the observed values yields an improved model for sunspot brightness temperature. Observations show that sunspots are darker than QS at wavelengths below 2 mm and brighter beyond, while fitting of the ATLCW sunspot model imply that sunspots should be darker than QS over the entireALMArange. The best-fitted sunspot brightness temperature profiles resulted in 3.6-4.0 times lower sunspot density compared to the original sunspot ATLCW model, or 1.4-1.8 times higher density compared to QS. The temperature came out around 1.2 times higher than the original ATLCW predictions for sunspots, or 1.2 times lower than QS temperature. Even with improved density and temperature parameters, the remaining discrepancy between the bestfitted models and observations indicated that additional improvements are needed in the ATLCW model and modeling assumptions."}

These effects may be most pronounced in ultra-hot Jupiters that sustain global magnetic fields. WASP-18 b hosts an ionized dayside atmosphere extending deep enough to be strongly influenced by magnetic forces. Phase curve observations suggest effective magnetic drag, yet its impact on the atmospheric circulation remains poorly constrained. This work explores how magnetic drag in an inhomogeneously ionized atmosphere shapes local and global dynamics to provide a pathway to constrain the planet's magnetic field strength. An analytical parameterization for anisotropic magnetic drag, including both Pedersen and Hall drag components, and associated frictional heating in the globally neutral atmosphere, is implemented in the 3D General Circulation Model ExoRad to study WASP-18 b's atmosphere. Climate characteristics are compared for different drag formulations to assess whether anisotropic physics is required to capture magnetic coupling effects. Anisotropic magnetic drag and frictional heating, both set by local ionization, strongly affect wind strength and direction in the upper atmosphere, modify the day-night circulation, and produce observable temperature asymmetries. They enhance the evening-morning terminator temperature difference near 0.1 bar and generate two off-equator hotspots with reduced eastward shift. The terminator regions are particularly sensitive to how magnetic drag is modeled. Anisotropic magnetic drag damps and redirects dayside-to-nightside winds, partially decoupling the equatorial flow at the morning terminator while maintaining the nightside jet. Locally varying drag forces and frictional heating create asymmetric temperature patterns manifesting as primary and secondary hotspot regions."}

Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times.

The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves.

We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra.

Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field."}

Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals.

The system produces joint light-curves containing both visible and near-infrared photometry, and joint image cutouts. Using Zwicky Transient Facility alerts as a proxy for Rubin, we demonstrate the system in use in cases where Euclid did and did not detect the transient and highlight the value that can be added in each case. For transients detected by Euclid these benefits include identifying the supernovae (SNe) in observations taken prior to ground-based detection, thereby better constraining the explosion time, such as SN 2024pvw detected ~3 d prior to ground based detections. In cases where Euclid did not detect the transient, we demonstrate the benefit of adding Euclid observations to improve host morphology measurements and associations."}

The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\\sim 5-12 \\times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations. We calculate a lower-bound rotational mass estimate for UMa III/U1 and a corresponding lower bound mass-to-light ratio of $ 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \\mathrm{M_\\odot} / \\mathrm{L_\\odot} $ for the total population.

The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies."}

Verification and disk-center results for the solar Ca I 4227 Å line", "comment": null, "summary": "Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 Å in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \\times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data."}

Their primordial nature holds key clues to the evolution of the Solar System. It has been suggested that the volatile-rich bodies formed in the outer Solar System and were implanted into the main belt. Alternatively, volatiles may have been delivered via inward-drifting icy pebbles in the protosolar disk. Here, we examine whether in-situ formed rocky embryos can acquire volatiles through pebble accretion as the snowline migrated inward. With the turbulence strength of the disk, radial pebble flux, and the dimensionless stopping time of pebbles (St) as parameters, we calculate the growth of large asteroids. The results are then compared with mass and compositional constraints based on asteroid observations. We find that a moderate pebble flux ($\\lesssim18~M_\\oplus / \\text{Myr}$) is required to enable volatile delivery while preventing the largest asteroids from becoming more massive than Ceres. Water accretion is feasible with $\\mathrm{St} \\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\\sim 1$ mm). However, only the largest asteroids (D > 200 km) can accumulate sufficient ammonia under such conditions. For most asteroids with D between 100 and 200 km, ammonia ice accretion requires $\\mathrm{St} \\sim 10^{-4}$ ($\\sim 100\\,μ$m). Such small particle sizes may pose both theoretical and observational challenges.

LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane."}

Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named \"odd radio circles\" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra."}

The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect."}

As part of the Colombian Antarctic Telescopes for 21 cm Absorption during Reionization (CANTAR) initiative, we present a simulation and analysis framework to evaluate antenna chromaticity, optimize instrument design, and assess site suitability for global 21 cm experiments. Using frequency-dependent beam models and Haslam-based sky maps, we compute dynamic spectra for the EDGES blade dipole and a set of dipole and novel monopole antennas optimized via particle swarm optimization. The optimized designs exhibit improved spectral smoothness compared to EDGES, particularly in the 70-120 MHz range. We also evaluate latitude-dependent sky brightness and identify mid-latitude sites (-40° to +5°) as optimal for foreground suppression. We apply Bayesian inference together with posterior predictive model validation to the publicly released EDGES data, assessing statistical consistency rather than hypothesis testing or model comparison. We find that physically motivated foreground and ionospheric models are statistically consistent with the data only when a 21 cm absorption feature is excluded. From the validated posterior, we generate a statistically validated ensemble of foreground corrections for use in beam-sky simulations. These results support a two-phase strategy for CANTAR: Antarctic deployments for calibration and testing, and future science operations at mid-latitude sites. Our framework provides a validated path toward robust foreground modeling, antenna design, and systematics control for global 21 cm signal detection."}

The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\\rm R, \\star}=2433\\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\\rm R,HI}=2423\\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\\rm GC}/M_\\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs."}

Typically, the power-law index exceeds 1 in the low-frequency part ($α_\\mathrm{lf}$) and is around 0 at high frequencies ($α_\\mathrm{hf}$). This work investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions. The spatial distribution of the power-law index in the low-frequency domain ($α_\\mathrm{lf}$) closely mirrors EUV intensity images, indicating that $α_\\mathrm{lf}$ can reveal the dynamics of coronal plasma structures. Temporally, $α_\\mathrm{lf}$ remains stable in quiescent active regions, but it exhibits significant variability before the flare onset. Motivated by this behaviour, we analysed 14 flare events, quantifying the temporal variation of the indices $α_\\mathrm{lf}$ and $α_\\mathrm{hf}$ as potential flare precursors. In all flare events considered, notable deviations of $α_\\mathrm{lf}$ beyond a defined threshold consistently occurred at the flare site within a few minutes before the flare. In some cases, the change in the value of $α_\\mathrm{lf} - α_\\mathrm{hf}$ was detected within 30--90\\, minutes before the flare. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the temporal variation of the power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra could potentially serve as short-term precursors of solar flares, which needs to be validated on a larger flare sample."}

If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected."}

Building on this work, we train a neural network on six years of HARPS-N solar data with additional parameters commonly associated to stellar activity, including chromatic CCFs, line shape metrics, spectral activity indicators, total solar irradiance (TSI) light curves from SORCE and TSIS-1, and TSI time derivatives. Our results show that parameters such as the bisector inverse slope and Na D equivalent widths do not significantly improve the neural network's ability to predict activity-induced RV variations compared to using the white light CCFs alone. However, parameters such as unsigned magnetic flux, the TSI and its time derivative, S-index, H-alpha equivalent width, chromatic CCFs, contrast, and full width at half maximum do improve the neural network's ability to predict RV scatter. Our new model reduces the RV scatter in a held-out test set from 147.1 cm/s to 93.3 cm/s, consistent with supergranulation noise levels reported in previous studies. These results suggest that finding effective tracers for (super)granulation will be critical to train models capable of further mitigating RV jitter, and necessary for characterizing Earth analogues."}

While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored."}

Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks."}

We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe."}

We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties."}

However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE."}

Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named \"odd radio circles\" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra."}

Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\\rm b}\\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\\oplus$). By measuring its density ($ρ_{\\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $ρ_\\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope.

Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $Δ$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%.

In this work, we demonstrate a new unsupervised deep learning framework using Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network Autoencoders to encode generalized feature representations across both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions spanning $19$ optical emission lines (3800A $< λ<$ 8000A) among a sample of $\\sim 9000$ galaxies from the MaNGA IFS survey. As a demonstrative exercise, we assess our model on a sample of $290$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and highlight scientifically interesting characteristics of some highly anomalous AGN."}

Appendices add 21 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "summary": "We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties."}

However, classical spectroscopic methods can often be computationally expensive, rendering them impractical for the analysis of large datasets. We introduce a novel simulation-based deep-learning approach for the efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra to be obtained with the upcoming high-resolution 4MOST spectrograph. We used a suite of synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations and trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for the purpose of predicting self-consistently stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances. The cINN is a neural network architecture that estimates full posterior distributions for the target stellar properties, providing an intrinsic uncertainty estimate. We evaluated the predictive performance of the trained cINN model on both synthetic data and observed spectra of stars. We found that our new cINN trained on NLTE synthetic spectra is capable of recovering stellar parameters with average errors ($σ$) of $33$ K for $T_\\mathrm{eff}$, $0.16$ dex for $\\log(g)$, and $0.12$ dex for [Fe/H], $0.1$ dex for [Ca/Fe], $0.11$ for [Mg/Fe], and $0.51$ dex for [Li/Fe], respectively, at a signal to noise ratio of 250 per Angstrom. From the analysis of the observed spectra of Gaia-ESO / 4MOST / PLATO benchmark stars, we verified that our NLTE estimates for stellar parameters and abundances are consistent with results obtained with the independent code TSFitPy. We conclude that the NLTE cINN is robust and can, theoretically, evaluate 4 million high-resolution 4MOST spectra in less than a day, using GPU acceleration."}
