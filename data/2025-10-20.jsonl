They are especially frequent on M dwarfs,\nwhere they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency\ndistributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have\nproposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare\nmechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical\ndistribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both\nequivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and\nbolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We\nanalyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares.\nComplex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both\nmissions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of\nmagnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting\nintrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs\ndeviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal\ndistribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near\n$10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a\nchange in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with\nimplications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The\napparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior\narises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above\n$10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or\ncurrent observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to\nprobe both regimes."}

We analyze the dynamics in triaxial\nmerger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear\ndiscs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently\nextract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial\neccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D\nanalytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening.\nWe present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression\nof high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$):\nmigration rates $\\tau_a^{-1} \\propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates\n$\\tau_e^{-1} \\propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy,\n$\\tau_e/\\tau_a \\propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\\approx 0.2$),\neccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\\tau_e\n\\approx 0.04 \\, \\tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to\nquantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and\nturbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and\nemploy a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity\ndistribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping,\nthe strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium\neccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear.\nHence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This\ncircularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational\nwave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger\ntimescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar\nrelaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in\ncosmological frameworks."}

While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically\nmodeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal\nsphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other\ninternal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the\ninner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower\nincrease of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object.\nWhile the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner\norbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic\nindex $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular\nmomentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in\namplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are\nbetter correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object\ncontained within the simulation domain.

Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly\nduring the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet\nformation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is\nparticularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of\nmolecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods.\nIn this work, we present high-resolution ($\\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3\nmillimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected\nlarge, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and\nHCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing\ncentral, more compact regions.

One common method focuses on\nstrong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple \"images\": repeated\ncopies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival\ntime, and overall \"Morse phase.\" The literature identifies two separate\napproaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on\nfrequentist and Bayesian approaches.

They are especially frequent on M dwarfs,\nwhere they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency\ndistributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have\nproposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare\nmechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical\ndistribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both\nequivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and\nbolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We\nanalyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares.\nComplex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both\nmissions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of\nmagnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting\nintrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs\ndeviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal\ndistribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near\n$10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a\nchange in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with\nimplications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The\napparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior\narises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above\n$10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or\ncurrent observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to\nprobe both regimes."}

In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite\nfound a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star\nTOI-283.

Four objects are consistent with\nknown classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the\nother hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and\nrapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal\nreclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations\nprovide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate\nthat deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would\neffectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We\nalso discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of\nunderstanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients."}

We model CR\ninjection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR\nprotons, and obtain their $\\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated\nCR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,\nwhich evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing\ndirect comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters.

These protons provide the basis for diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes.

Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence\ncompanion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\\gamma$-ray emission\nlocations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,\nrespectively.

A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation\ncollaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor\nconstellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates\n(BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the\nfrequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among\ndifferent missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current\nrequirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a\ncustomized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty,\nnamed \"BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and\nSummary Tools\" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated,\nsemi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of\nprompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while\nmaintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of\nBREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST\nalso aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes\nthrough rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge\nbetween prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a\nsuite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly\nthe specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on\nprompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been\ndemonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a\nsignificant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the\nfuture."}
