However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$\"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \\pm 0.03}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \\pm 0.65}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\\pm0.53}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets."}

In the absence of giant planets, carbon-rich rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes may be common. We outline observations that support their presence and discuss habitability of terrestrial worlds."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\\%$ and $0.15\\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics."}

However, the direct measurement of the stellar IMF is confined to the local universe, limited by the resolving power of telescopes. Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies.

It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing."}

The stellar masses, specific star formation rates, and mass-weighted stellar ages of the simulated BGGs are analysed alongside those of observed BGGs from X-ray-selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field. We find that the global properties and underlying evolutionary pathways of simulated BGG populations are strongly impacted by the strength and mechanism of their respective active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback models, which play a critical role in regulating the growth of massive galaxies. OBSIDIAN's sophisticated three-regime AGN feedback model achieves the highest overall agreement with COSMOS observations, matching stellar property distributions, quenched fractions, and the evolution of star formation in increasingly massive systems. We find evidence suggesting that BGG populations of OBSIDIAN and COSMOS undergo a gradual decline in star formation with stellar mass, in contrast to SIMBA and SIMBA-C, which display rapid quenching linked to the onset of powerful AGN jet feedback. By comparison, ROMULUS produces highly star-forming, under-quenched BGGs due to the inefficiency of its thermal AGN feedback in preventing cooling flows from fuelling BGG growth. The success of the OBSIDIAN simulation demonstrates the importance of physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for realistically capturing the processes that shape BGGs and their dynamic group environments."}

Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $χ^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets."}

In these new 2$-$4 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array images, we detect 38 of the 49 confirmed pulsars, including extensive multi-frequency eclipse mapping of the luminous redback Ter5A. Nonetheless, there is still a large amount of diffuse residual flux from pulsars that are fainter than our 2.5 GHz continuum detection limit of $\\sim 11\\,μ$Jy. Using a range of approaches including image-based simulations, we model the fluxes of the detected pulsars together with the residual flux. We find a minimum total population of $N\\sim250$ detectable pulsars in Terzan 5 and perhaps substantially more, though the luminosity function remains very uncertain. Consideration of the $γ$-ray properties of the cluster, though also not unambiguous to interpret, leads to consistent conclusions. These pulsar population estimates are larger than inferred from previous work and highlight Terzan 5 as a keystone target for next-generation radio facilities."}

Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $α= e^2/\\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $α$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of $α$ measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond $Λ$CDM."}

This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research."}

Methods", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms."}

Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models."}

More Generic Climate Feedback Configurations Still Allow Temperate Climates in Habitable Zone Exo-Earth Candidates", "comment": "29 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal", "summary": "Earth's climate is influenced by over a dozen feedbacks, but only three dominate its long-term climate behavior. Models of the exoplanet habitable zone (HZ) assume that this is similar for other Earth-like planets. We used dynamical simulations to study Earth-like planets with a fourth, (potentially strong) generalized climate feedback. Across over 20,000 climate simulations, we find that the addition of the fourth feedback produces novel behaviors, including runaway and chaotic climate trajectories, that are more diverse than one would expect based on Earth's climate configuration. Non-negligible fourth feedbacks -- if negative -- would not lessen the probability of planets with temperate climates. However, positive fourth feedbacks decrease the fraction of exo-Earth candidates that are long-term habitable. Therefore, strong fourth feedbacks will alter (and mostly shrink) the boundaries of the classical habitable zone. When combined with occurrence rates of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars, our results imply that the fraction of stars hosting rocky planets with temperate climates may be substantially lower than classical estimates under Earth-like climate assumptions. Our results are subject to the validity of the model assumptions and not intended to represent conclusive predictions about exoplanet populations but rather to demonstrate the potential climate diversity that emerges from non-Earth-like model configurations.

We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey.

In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \\gtrsim 100\\, \\text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-Żytków objects (TŻOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes."}

Based on a uniform data reduction of 411 DEIMOS masks, we present a catalog of individual stellar radial velocities, equivalent width-based [Fe/H] metallicities, and membership estimates. The Milky Way satellites range from M_V = 2 to -14 (M* = 10^1.5 to 10^7.5 Msun); the majority of individual stars presented in these systems have magnitudes 17 > r > 22. The data were reduced to 1D spectra using PypeIt, which provides near Poisson statistics-level sky subtraction. Radial velocities were determined via dmost, a forward modeling method first presented here, which combines both synthetic telluric and stellar templates to determine stellar radial velocities. We assess the accuracy and precision our method via comparison to thousands of repeat measurements and literature values. We determine a velocity error floor of 1.1 km/s and a CaII triplet-based metallicity error floor of 0.1 dex. We calculate internal velocity dispersions and compare to literature values, demonstrating 20-50% improved precision over the literature in most cases. In a companion paper, we use our homogeneous catalogs to explore properties of these Milky Way satellites, including previously unpublished measurements in several systems including Bootes II and Draco II. We provide full access to the data catalogs to enable further studies."}

The influence on the episodic instability of the inner rim is hereby of central interest. 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models are employed to simulate the evolution of the inner disc over several thousand years. Our simulations greatly expand on previous models by implementing detailed opacity descriptions in terms of their mean and frequency-dependent values, allowing us to also consider binned frequency-dependent irradiation. The adaptive opacity description significantly affects the structure of the inner disc rim, with gas opacities exerting the greatest influence. The resulting effects include shifts in the position of both the dust sublimation front and the dead zone inner edge, a significantly altered temperature in the dust-free region and the manifestation of an equilibrium temperature degeneracy as a sharp temperature transition. The episodic instability due to MRI activation in the dead zone still occurs, but at lower inner disc densities. While the gas opacities set the initial conditions for the instability, the evolution of the outburst itself is mainly governed by the dust opacities. The analysis of criteria for non-axisymmetric instabilities reveals possible breaking of the density peaks produced by the burst. However, due to the periodicity of the instability, the inner edge itself may remain stable throughout quiescent phases according to linear criteria. Although the thermal structure of the inner disc is crucially affected by different opacity descriptions, the mechanism of the periodic instability of the DZIE remains active and is only marginally influenced by gas opacities. The observational consequences of the severely altered temperatures may be significant and require further investigation."}

While direct observations of solar activity cover only the past few decades, indirect evidence indicates that the Sun can occasionally produce events orders of magnitude stronger than any recorded ones in the modern era. Two complementary lines of evidence exist. First, extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) have been inferred from prominent spikes in cosmogenic isotope concentrations preserved in precisely dated natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores over the past 15 millennia. Second, high-precision space-borne photometry has revealed superflares on thousands of stars similar to the Sun. Whether these solar and stellar extremes are physically related remains an open question. We summarise the present state of understanding and discuss physical mechanisms that may link them. Although superflares and ESPEs are both extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, their relationship does not appear to be one-to-one. Their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration."}

Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V ~ -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era."}

Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3$σ$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering."}

Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources."}

In this work, we use TESS transits to investigate the occurrence of hot SEs in systems with known CJs detected by radial velocity (RV). Out of a statistical sample of 132 CJ systems, we identify five transiting hot super-Earths ($1$-$4R_\\oplus$, $P<10\\mathrm{d}$) around four stars, including one new candidate (TOI-6965.01) around HD 50554. To enable statistical analysis, we first validate the two candidates around HD 50554 using TESS photometry, archival RV measurements, and Gaia astrometry. After accounting for detection sensitivity and geometric transit probability, we find that the presence of CJs enhances the occurrence rate of hot super-Earths by a factor of $8.1^{+4.3}_{-3.2}$ relative to field stars, with the case of no enhancement ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level. Taking into account the average multiplicity of hot SEs, we find that about 87% of CJ systems host at least one hot SE. Our results provide strong supporting evidence for a positive SE-CJ correlation.

Its delay from the impulsive X-ray peak is consistent with the time it would take flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events is consistent with the ratio observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks and is inconsistent with ratios typically found in impulsive flares and solar energetic particle events produced by reconnection."}

We photometrically confirm that the absolute carbon abundance $A$(C) separates CEMP stars into two primary groups, CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, consistent with previous spectroscopic studies. We also recover CEMP morphological Groups I-III in the Yoon-Beers diagram, as well as the recently proposed Group IV, and show that it is statistically distinct even in photometric data. A cumulative frequency analysis confirms that the CEMP fraction increases toward lower metallicity and that CEMP-no stars dominate in the most metal-poor regime. By comparing frequencies with and without Group IV stars, we assess their relation to CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, and examine CEMP distributions across different Galactic components. The resulting catalog provides a substantial sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, in particular to constrain the likely origin(s) of the Group IV stars."}

Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region."}

We perform a detailed dynamical analysis of approximately 200 ETGs spanning the redshift range $0.24 < z < 0.75$, utilizing spatially resolved stellar kinematics derived from high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) MUSE-DEEP spectroscopy and surface brightness models from high-resolution HST imaging. We constrain mass distributions using the Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) technique coupled with Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) method. To rigorously constrain evolutionary trends, we combine this intermediate-redshift dataset with a local ETG sample ($z \\sim 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. We adopt dynamical constraints for the local sample derived using an identical homogeneous methodology, ensuring a strictly consistent comparison. We found that the total density profiles of the intermediate-redshift ETG sample are approximately isothermal and exhibit a median mass-weighted total density slope, $<γ_{\\rm T}>=2.19 \\pm 0.01$ at $<z>=0.44$, which is shallower than the local baseline of $<γ_{\\rm T}> = 2.26 \\pm 0.01$ at $<z>=0.04$. This structural shift corresponds to a redshift gradient of $\\mathrm{d} γ_{\\rm T}/\\mathrm{d} z \\approx -0.20 \\pm 0.03$, detected at $\\sim$5-$σ$ significance. We demonstrate that this trend is robust against model assumptions and persists even when restricting the analysis to high-velocity dispersion systems ($σ_e > 150$ km/s). Our findings are consistent with previous lensing-based studies and in tension with cosmological simulations. The observed steepening suggests that dissipative processes, such as gas-rich accretion and mergers, must play a non-negligible role in the late-stage assembly of massive ETGs."}

In this paper, we aim to compile a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to provide new insights towards a unified accretion and ejection scenario between aligned and misaligned radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by considering their optical emission-line classifications (low- and high-excitation radio galaxies, LERGs, HERGs), which are more representative of their accretion states. We adopted statistical analyses of accretion properties and high-energy beaming patterns for both Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to investigate a unified accretion-ejection scenario. In the gamma-ray luminosity-photon index plane, HERGs populate the region of higher luminosities and softer photon indices, akin to FSRQs, whereas LERGs fill lower luminosities with harder photon indices, analogous to BL Lacs. This parallel segregation indicates that LERGs and HERGs represent the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs and FSRQs, respectively. The unified picture is further supported by the Compton dominance-photon index diagram, where FSRQs and HERGs dominated by external Compton (EC) emissions are distinctly separated from BL Lacs and LERGs governed by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emissions. Similarly, the diagram of accretion rate versus gamma-ray photon index reveals two distinct accretion-ejection states: a low-accretion-rate branch (BL Lacs and LERGs) is associated with the SSC model, and a high-accretion-rate branch (FSRQs and HERGs) is linked to the EC model. These results strongly strengthen the idea of a unified accretion and ejection paradigm between blazars and radio galaxies into two distinct states."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\\%$ and $0.15\\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively.

We obtained the NGC 3044 total intensity image at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with a resolution of 16 arcsec and an rms noise of 20 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The sensitivity is higher than the previous observations at similar frequencies. We find that the ASKAP intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk can be fit with two exponential components.

Beyond $\\sim3$ kpc, the velocity exceeds the escape speed of $\\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a strong wind. We further identify a possible superbubble of radius $\\sim3$ kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright H$α$ rim.

Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds."}

Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $χ^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six.

Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset."}

Interestingly, we find two narrow X-ray pulses in the MXB, one of which temporally aligns with the main pulse of the FRB 221014 $\\sim5.70$ ms latter than the peak time of FRB 221014), resembling the feature found in MXB/FRB 200428. Furthermore, we did comprehensive comparison between MXB/FRB 221014 and MXB/FRB 200428, and find that while the two events share several common features, they also exhibit distinct differences, highlighting the variety of the MXB-FRB association morphology. This finding not only confirms the association between MXB and FRB but also provides new insights into the mechanism of and the relationship between FRB and MXB."}

Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving >91% flux and increasing SNR by >6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors.

AFGL2233 has been proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning. Studying its chemistry is essential to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction."}

However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N > 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers."}

Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \\textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\\sim 3$, from rare to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable.

Building upon the foundational work of Field (1965) and the subsequent analysis by Waters and Proga (2019), this study revisits the characteristics of thermal instability in a uniform, non-magnetic medium. Our primary aim is to reevaluate and expand the understanding of instability domains, focusing on the classification and characteristics of thermal and acoustic modes in the presence of heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. Except for Spitzers expression for parallel thermal conductivity, the heating and cooling processes are unspecified. Additionally, we investigate the existence of isobaric and isochoric thermal modes across the extreme limits of very short and very long wavelengths, as well as at intermediate wavelengths. We perform an in-depth analysis of the dispersion relation for an infinite, uniform hydrodynamic medium, as initially derived by Field (1965). This approach enables the generation of growth-rate and dispersion diagrams, providing insight into the behaviour of thermal instability across different wavelength ranges. With the inclusion of thermal conduction, our study refines the classification of the seven instability regions previously outlined by Waters and Proga (2019). Our findings confirm that their classification holds when the Field length is smaller than or comparable to the thermal wavelength. For larger Field lengths, a simplified classification becomes impractical. Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of the catastrophic cooling instability (Waters and Stricklan 2025) in the context of cool coronal rain formation. Our work not only validates certain classifications, but also proposes new insights into complex instability behaviours, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework established by Field and others."}

The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\\leq$ [M/H] $\\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex."}

The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$.

We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models.

Here we measure the deflector scale (Einstein mass) and deflector environment (halo mass) of 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses in the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution With Lenses (AGEL) survey. We classify deflector scale by measuring $θ_{\\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(<θ_{\\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $Σ_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $Σ_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments. Our study provides a method to identify strong lenses as a function of deflector environment and approximate the impact of large-scale environment in lens modeling.

While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases.

However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$\"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \\pm 0.03}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \\pm 0.65}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\\pm0.53}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C.

This feature has been proposed as a promising electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers detectable by LISA. In this work, we examine whether non-thermal X-ray emission powered by magnetic reconnection could obscure or modify this thermal X-ray drop. We construct semi-analytic models for both the thermal X-ray emission from minidiscs and the non-thermal synchrotron emission produced by reconnection in magnetically dominated black hole magnetospheres. Evaluating these models across the MBHB mass range relevant for LISA, we find that for physically motivated magnetic field strengths and accretion rates, the non-thermal X-ray luminosity remains several orders of magnitude below the thermal component throughout the inspiral. Even under optimistic assumptions that enhance the non-thermal emission, it remains significantly subdominant. We further incorporate the magnetospheric balding framework to model the decay of non-thermal emission near merger, finding that reconnection-powered X-ray emission fades on short, mass-scaled timescales once the external magnetic flux supply is disrupted. Taken together, our results indicate that non-thermal emission is unlikely to mask the disappearing thermal X-ray signature, reinforcing its robustness as an electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers and its potential utility for multi-messenger studies with LISA."}

It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing."}

A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission.

We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms."}

Submitted to AJ", "summary": "Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) will be crucial for studies of galaxy evolution, large-scale structure, and transients with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources."}

Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models."}

We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$σ$ level of significance.

In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \\gtrsim 100\\, \\text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-Żytków objects (TŻOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes."}

Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region."}

Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3$σ$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering."}

However, the direct measurement of the stellar IMF is confined to the local universe, limited by the resolving power of telescopes. Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies. In this proceeding, I summarize the contributed talk given at IAUS402 entitled the same as this contribution and highlight some key results, which currently show no evidence for a top-heavy IMF in $z \\approx 1$ galaxies."}

Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \\textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\\sim 3$, from rare to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources."}

Abstract abridged for arXiv", "summary": "The X-ray output of low-metallicity starburst galaxies is a key component of stellar feedback, tracing the processes responsible for gas ionization and chemical enrichment. The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})\\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\\sim10^{39}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$."}
