The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides\na natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical\nsimulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and\nREBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues\nembedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an\n$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either\nan extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form\nKuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk\ninteractions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar\nencounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with\nejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that\ncometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of\nplanet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the\narchitecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments."}

Cosmic ray (CR) electrons\nare likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large\ndiffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively\nunmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy\n($E_{\\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand,\nrecent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be\nsuppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating\nplasma-scale magnetic structures, or \"micromirrors,\" that efficiently scatter\nCRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement\nfor shock acceleration in the ICM.

High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium\nstructure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned\nwith the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous\ngravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from\nmagnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO,\nDeci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute\nthe resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum\nloss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale\nfor detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while\nthe object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could\ndetect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its\nmission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive,\nfast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\\sim416$ s and\ninferred surface field $\\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be\ndetectable by LISA with four years of continuous data.

We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends\nonly part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all\nfour empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and\nperiods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25\nsolar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and\ndust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via\nscaling with luminosity).

This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for\na disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

We confirm 46 as genuine HADS variables,\nwith 40 stars having their dominant frequencies identified for the first time.\nAmong them, 7 pulsate solely in the fundamental mode; 21 exhibit the\nfundamental mode alongside at least one low-amplitude nonradial mode; 5 are\npure double-mode pulsators (the fundamental and first-overtone modes), 13 show\ndouble-mode pulsations accompanied by additional low-amplitude nonradial modes.\nThe remaining four stars are classified as other types of variables: two (TIC\n69546708 and TIC 110937533) are confirmed hot subdwarfs, one (TIC 8765832) is a\ncataclysmic variable, and one (TIC 32302937) is a likely hot subluminous star,\nbut it requires further spectroscopic confirmation. We investigate the\nperiod-luminosity (PL) relation, also known as the Leavitt law, for these 46\nconfirmed HADS stars, deriving a revised relation: $M_{V}= (-3.31\n\\pm0.39)~\\mathrm{log}~P+(-1.68 \\pm 0.39)$. This result is consistent with\nprevious studies. Their distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nindicates that HADS stars are not strictly confined to be within a narrow\ninstability strip previously found, but can extend beyond it, with a\ndistribution toward lower temperatures. The refined classifications presented\nhere establish a high-quality sample for precise asteroseismic modelling and\nenhance the potential for future machine-learning-assisted searches and\nclassifications of HADS stars in large-scale photometric surveys."}

The external medium also\ninfluences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with\nthe high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes\nsmaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a\nlong duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and\nmagnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing\nexternal density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium\nregulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance\nand angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores."}

The former are expected to follow the cosmic star\nformation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR.\nHowever, this division has come under question in several ways, the most\nprominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at\nlow redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in\narXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift\nLGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are\ncompact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift\nLGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers.\nMost results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than\n200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use\na larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has\nincreased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we\nadd a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning\n(ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample\nsize, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of\nredshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric,\nnon-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation\nbetween luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us\nto use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the\nluminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample\nwith measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which\ntend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced."}

In TDEs it is expected that the\norbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the\nSMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk\nprecessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this\npaper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such\nTDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous\nsuper-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the\ndisk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray\nradiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer\nand the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)\nThe smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The\ndimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to\nmoderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions\ntake turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the\nX-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other\ntwice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one\ncycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray\nand optical emissions.

This work deals with a\npotential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational\nevidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its\nin others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time\nintervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during\nthe galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time inter-\nvals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star\nclusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs.

Several studies have explored LNSS architecture\nusing geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing\nLNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using\nanalytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south\npole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)\nand lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with\nEarth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not\nbeen adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary\nmulti-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar\norbit propagation model.

The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse\nset of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV\nrequirements.

In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the\nflat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the\nmaximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike\ninformation criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors\nevolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no\nstatistically significant evidence for any plateau.

In TDEs it is expected that the\norbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the\nSMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk\nprecessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this\npaper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such\nTDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous\nsuper-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the\ndisk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray\nradiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer\nand the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)\nThe smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The\ndimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to\nmoderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions\ntake turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the\nX-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other\ntwice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one\ncycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray\nand optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for\ninterpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics\nand gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of\nJ045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously."}

For high-resolution figures, please see the\n  published version", "summary": "Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST\nslitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework\nbased on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects,\nclassifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing\ntraditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both\ncompact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded\nfields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy)\nand discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins),\nshowcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing.\nOur framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial\nfeatures holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection\nprecision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned\nredshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a\nparadigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification,\nand preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will\nconcentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from\nraw spectral traces."}

Dullemond"], "title": "What is the nature of late infall streamers?", "comment": "12 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (referee\n  stage: minor revisions)", "summary": "Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks\nmay undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late\ninfall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for\na disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find\nconsiderable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which\nmay act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas\nsurrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which\nplanets form."}
