### [1] [Overestimated Pressure Broadening Misleads Model Spectra in Cool M Dwarf Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05313)
*Ana Glidden,Veronika Witzke,Alexander I. Shapiro,Sara Seager*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 现有的一维恒星模型无法准确重现超冷M矮星TRAPPIST-1的光谱特征，尤其是对FeH吸收带的预测与观测结果不符。研究发现van der Waals展宽假设对光谱特征有显著影响，并建议重新评估分子线的压力展宽处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的一维恒星模型无法准确再现TRAPPIST-1等中晚型M矮星的光谱特征，尤其在FeH吸收带和近红外水带之间的连续谱形状上存在明显差异。这限制了恒星性质和行星大气成分的精确测定。

Method: 研究使用Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS生成合成的光谱，覆盖不同van der Waals展宽强度范围，并基于1D PHOENIX温度-压力结构进行分析。

Result: 发现最小展宽强度最能匹配观测到的0.99μm FeH吸收带和大型水带之间的伪连续谱特征。

Conclusion: 结果表明，适用于太阳型恒星的展宽经验公式不适用于低质量恒星，需重新评估冷恒星大气中分子线的压力展宽处理，以提高M矮星光谱模型的准确性。

Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$μ$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$μ$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.

### [2] [On the gravitational stratification of multi-fluid-multi-species plasma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05321)
*F. Zhang,J. Martínez-Sykora,Q. M. Wargnier,V. H. Hansteen*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种构建满足电离和流体静力平衡的多流体-多物种重力分层的方法，以避免初始不平衡导致的非物理扰动和数值不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳大气由多层不同温度的等离子体组成，电离程度差异显著。现有模型中，电离和复合过程的整合仍具挑战性，可能导致初始不平衡和非物理扰动。

Method: 假设无高频外力时，流体间碰撞耦合足以维持平衡。通过统计平衡或模型提取电离分数，设计数值积分程序构建多流体-多物种分层。

Result: 构建的分层满足流体静力平衡，且在过渡区出现流体解耦现象，但总速度保持为零。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于多流体-多物种模型，避免初始不平衡对动态研究的干扰。

Abstract: Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.

### [3] [Dispersive Properties of MHD Waves in the Expanding Solar Wind for a Parker Spiral Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05357)
*Sebastián Saldivia,Felipe Asenjo,Pablo S. Moya*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 研究量化了太阳风膨胀对理想MHD三种正常模式色散特性的影响，揭示了膨胀如何重塑太阳风中压缩波动的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索太阳风膨胀如何通过MHD-EBM框架影响MHD模式的色散性质，特别是压缩波动和横向波动的能量重分布。

Method: 使用扩展盒模型（EBM）和线性化MHD-EBM方程，构建色散张量并推导特征频率、磁压缩性和电场/磁场比的解析表达式。

Result: 磁压缩性随日心距离增加而上升，与观测数据更吻合；快慢模式在膨胀下呈现相反行为；膨胀在内日球层波动动力学演化中起主要作用。

Conclusion: 太阳风膨胀通过重分布能量主动影响MHD模式的径向演化，是内日球层波动动力学的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $ω(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|δE_\parallel|/|δB_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|δE_\parallel|/|δB_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了对HWO任务目标恒星的光学散斑成像研究，旨在调查恒星的多重性，以确保任务成功并指导设计决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保HWO直接成像任务的顺利进行，并为目标恒星的选择提供科学依据。

Method: 使用Gemini天文台的Alopeke和Zorro进行光学散斑成像，并结合Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive的存档数据，对80颗恒星进行了分析。

Result: 确认了一个候选伴星（HD 90089），并检测到一个已知伴星（HD 212330），灵敏度测试表明75%-85%的低质量伴星可被检测到。

Conclusion: 该研究为HWO目标恒星的多重性调查提供了初步结果，并将进一步指导后续观测和目标选择。

Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.

### [5] [Structural Tilting and Depth-Dependent Behavior of Equatorial Rossby Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05443)
*Oana Vesa,Junwei Zhao,Ruizhu Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 本文研究了太阳赤道罗斯比波的倾斜结构和时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RD和TD日震学数据探索罗斯比波的结构倾斜和功率，以了解其对太阳内部动力学的影响。

Method: 通过分析SDO/HMI约14.5年的数据，计算归一化相位差和交叉功率。

Result: 发现罗斯比波的相位行为与太阳周期无明显相关，而交叉功率与太阳周期正相关；波的相位随深度增加而减小。

Conclusion: 罗斯比波具有稳定的逆向倾斜结构，这对太阳内部的角动量和能量传输具有重要意义。

Abstract: Over the past decade, solar equatorial Rossby waves have been unambiguously identified and are considered potential diagnostics of solar interior dynamics. We investigate their inclined structure and temporal evolution in the solar interior across multiple depths using approximately 14.5 yr of ring-diagram (RD) and time-distance (TD) helioseismology data from SDO/HMI. Normalized phase differences and cross power are computed from filtered spherical harmonic coefficients of radial vorticity to probe the structural tilt and power of Rossby waves. We find a systematic and robust depth-dependent phase behavior that shows no clear significant correlation with the solar cycle, while the depth-dependent cross power exhibits a positive correlation with the solar cycle for both datasets. Our results show that deeper depths lead in phase over shallower ones, with increasing negative phases with depth. We infer that Rossby waves exhibit a retrograde tilt relative to the Sun's rotation that is stable throughout the solar cycle. Analogous small tilts have been noted in planetary atmospheres and in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Sun, indicating that this behavior is not uncommon in rotating, stratified bodies and has implications for angular momentum and energy transport in the solar interior.

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解太阳爆发机制并改进空间天气预报模型。

Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, often impacting space weather and terrestrial technologies. In this study, we utilize SunPy, an open-source Python library for solar physics, to analyze solar active regions and their correlation with flare and CME events observed on 4th January 2025. Data from GOES, SDO (AIA and HMI), Solar Oribter (STIX), e-CALLISTO, Aditya L1 (SUIT), and SOHO are processed to track flare intensity, active region evolution, shock wave and CME dynamics. The analyzed flare is identified as an X1.8-class event, and our study highlights key magnetic precursors that led to it. This work enhances understanding of solar eruption precursors and supports future predictive models for space weather forecasting.

### [7] [Impact of Newly Measured Nuclear Reaction Rates on $^{26}$Al Ejected Yields from Massive Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05672)

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文回顾了过去三年中对涉及$^{26}$Al破坏和产生的核心反应的重新评估，并通过新实验数据降低了不确定性。使用FRANEC模拟高质量恒星爆炸，对比新旧反应率对$^{26}$Al和其他关键核素产量的影响，发现新反应率导致$^{26}$Al产量变化约3倍。同时，讨论了早期太阳系短寿命放射性核素比例，发现单一星源无法完全匹配，可能需要第二个星源。

Motivation: 重新评估涉及$^{26}$Al的核反应率，以减少核物理不确定性对恒星核合成的影响，并探索这些变化对高质量恒星爆炸产生的$^{26}$Al和其他核素产量的具体影响。

Method: 使用FRANEC恒星代码模拟20 Msun高质量恒星（金属丰度Z=0.0134）在不同爆炸能量下的爆炸，对比新旧核反应率（来自STARLIB和新实验数据）对$^{26}$Al和其他关键核素产量的影响。

Result: 新反应率使$^{26}$Al的总喷射量变化约3倍，并影响其他短寿命放射性核素的预测丰度。单一高质量恒星模型无法完全匹配早期太阳系所有核素比例，可能需要第二个星源。

Conclusion: 新核反应率显著影响$^{26}$Al和其他核素的预测产量，但仅靠高质量恒星模型无法解释所有早期太阳系数据，暗示需要第二个星源的贡献。

Abstract: Over the last three years, the rates of all the main nuclear reactions involving the destruction and production of $^{26}$Al in stars ($^{26}$Al(n, p)$^{26}$Mg, $^{26}$Al(n, $α$)$^{23}$Na, $^{26}$Al(p, $γ$)$^{27}$Si and $^{25}$Mg(p, $γ$)$^{26}$Al) have been re-evaluated thanks to new high-precision experimental measurements of their cross sections at energies of astrophysical interest, considerably reducing the uncertainties in the nuclear physics affecting their nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthetic yields ejected by the explosion of a high-mass star (20 Msun, Z = 0.0134) using the FRANEC stellar code, considering two explosion energies, 1.2 10$^{51}$ erg and 3 10$^{51}$ erg. We quantify the change in the ejected amount of $^{26}$Al and other key species that is predicted when the new rate selection is adopted instead of the reaction rates from the STARLIB nuclear library. Additionally, the ratio of our ejected yields of 26Al to those of 14 other short-lived radionuclides (36Cl, 41Ca, 53Mn, 60Fe, 92Nb, 97Tc, 98Tc, 107Pd, 126Sn, 129I, 36Cs, 146Sm, 182Hf, 205Pb) are compared to early solar system isotopic ratios, inferred from meteorite measurements. The total ejected 26Al yields vary by a factor of ~3 when adopting the new rates or the STARLIB rates. Additionally, the new nuclear reaction rates also impact the predicted abundances of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system relative to $^{26}$Al. However, it is not possible to reproduce all the short-lived radionuclide isotopic ratios with our massive star model alone, unless a second stellar source could be invoked, which must have been active in polluting the pristine solar nebula at a similar time of a core-collapse supernova.

Motivation: 理解26Al的宇宙产生对研究恒星和星系演化至关重要，但现有模拟受核反应不确定性限制。

Method: 结合n TOF实验数据和理论预测，重新计算26Al的反应性，并使用Monash、NuGrid mppnp和FUNS代码模拟低质量和高质量恒星的核合成。

Result: 新反应性使低质量AGB恒星能重现SiC颗粒测量的26Al/27Al比值范围，高质量恒星的26Al丰度变化因子为2.4。恒星核合成仍需进一步减少不确定性。

Conclusion: 新反应性显著改善恒星核合成模型与观测数据的匹配，但未来需在T9~0.3至2.5范围内进一步减小不确定性。

Abstract: The cosmic production of the short-lived radioactive nuclide 26Al is crucial for our understanding of the evolution of stars and galaxies. However, simulations of the stellar sites producing 26Al are still weakened by significant nuclear uncertainties. We re-evaluate the 26Al(n, p)26Mg, and 26Al(n, α)23Na ground state reactivities from 0.01 GK to 10 GK, based on the recent n TOF measurement combined with theoretical predictions and a previous measurement at higher energies, and test their impact on stellar nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthesis of low- and high-mass stars using the Monash nucleosynthesis code, the NuGrid mppnp code, and the FUNS stellar evolutionary code. Our low-mass stellar models cover the 2-3 Msun mass range with metallicities between Z = 0.01 and 0.02, their predicted 26Al/27Al ratios are compared to 62 meteoritic SiC grains. For high-mass stars, we test our reactivities on two 15 Msun models with Z = 0.006 and 0.02. The new reactivities allow low-mass AGB stars to reproduce the full range of 26Al/27Al ratios measured in SiC grains. The final 26Al abundance in high-mass stars, at the point of highest production, varies by a factor of 2.4 when adopting the upper, or lower limit of our rates. However, stellar uncertainties still play an important role in both mass regimes. The new reactivities visibly impact both low- and high-mass stars nucleosynthesis and allow a general improvement in the comparison between stardust SiC grains and low-mass star models. Concerning explosive nucleosynthesis, an improvement of the current uncertainties between T9~0.3 and 2.5 is needed for future studies.

Conclusion: 相对磁螺旋度和无符号螺旋度对日冕动力学具有显著影响，为相关研究提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.

Conclusion: 综合分析支持M31-2014-DS1星低能量爆炸形成黑洞的假说，为黑洞形成的物理机制提供了首个一致性解释。

Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.

Abstract: Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars play a key role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. These stars are the fundamental stellar site for the production of light elements such as C, N and F, and half of the elements heavier than Fe via the slow neutron capture process (s-process). Hence, detailed computational models of AGB stars' evolution and nucleosynthesis are essential for galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we discuss the progress in updating the NuGrid data set of AGB stellar models and abundance yields. All stellar models have been computed using the MESA stellar evolution code, coupled with the post-processing mppnp code to calculate the full nucleosynthesis. The final data set will include the initial masses Mini/Msun = 1, 1.65, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for initial metallicities Z = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.006, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03. Observed s-process abundances on the surfaces of evolved stars as well as the typical light elements in the composition of H-deficient post-AGB stars are reproduced. A key short-term goal is to complete and expand the AGB stars data set for the full metallicity range. Chemical yield tables are provided for the available models.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 该研究重新评估了日冕物质抛射(CMEs)的核心部分与内日冕中爆发日珥的关系，发现白光观测与Hα日珥在空间上高度相关，确认核心主要由日珥物质组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为CMEs的明亮核心是日珥物质，但另一种观点认为可能是扭曲磁通绳的投影效应。研究旨在澄清CMEs核心的真实成分及其与日珥的关联。

Method: 利用MLSO K-Cor的白光观测分析CMEs核心，结合GONG的Hα数据和AIA的304 Å图像分析对应的日珥爆发，并通过LASCO/C2验证外日冕中物质的持久性。

Result: Hα日珥与白光CMEs核心的空间相关性高（~0.7），但与304 Å相关性较弱（~0.5）。线性轨迹假设会引入较大误差（位置角40°、时间140分钟）。

Conclusion: 研究支持与日珥相关的CMEs中，明亮核心主要由日珥物质组成，并强调内日冕观测对准确约束CMEs动力学的重要性。

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often exhibit a three-part structure consisting of a bright inner core, an outer leading edge, and an intervening dark cavity. While the core has traditionally been attributed to prominence material, an alternative interpretation suggests it may arise from the projection effects of a twisted flux rope. We focused on limb CME events to reassess the connection between CME cores and their associated prominences in the inner corona. The CME cores were analyzed using white-light observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Coronagraph (K-Cor), while the corresponding prominence eruptions were examined using H$α$ data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and 304 Å images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Our results show a strong spatial correspondence between H$α$ prominences and CME cores in white light, with an average image correlation of $\sim$0.7, while correlations between white light and AIA 304 Å are comparatively weaker ($\sim$0.5). Several events could be continuously traced into the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO/C2) field of view, confirming the persistence of prominence material into the outer corona. We find back-extrapolating LASCO/C2 CME cores under constant-velocity, linear-trajectory assumptions can introduce large errors -- up to 40$^\circ$ in inferred position angle and $\sim$140 minutes in eruption time relative to their true values -- underscoring the importance of inner-coronal observations for accurately constraining CME dynamics. Overall, our findings suggest that in prominence-associated CMEs, the bright cores are predominantly composed of prominence material.

Abstract: Stars that exhibit prominent emission lines in their spectra are referred to as emission-line stars, encompassing a wide range of stellar types and indicative of intriguing physical properties. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has released millions of spectra from its Medium-Resolution Survey (MRS). A small fraction of these spectra exhibit emission lines, yet they remain undiscovered and unanalyzed due to being buried in the vast dataset. We have developed a method based on Derivative Spectroscopy (DS), which provides a novel approach for detecting and identifying emission-line stars by extracting signals from complex backgrounds and estimating spectral line profiles. Applying this method to the $\mathrm{Hα}$ spectral line profiles from the LAMOST-MRS Data Release 7 (DR7), we compiled a catalog of emission-line stars using the second- and third-derivative spectra for automated peak detection. This approach also facilitates the classification of $\mathrm{Hα}$ emission-line morphologies through a simplified scheme. The catalog comprises 56\,649 spectra with relatively prominent $\mathrm{Hα}$ emission lines from 45\,206 unique stars, with each emission-line component accompanied by approximate estimates of its wavelength, amplitude, and width. All $\mathrm{Hα}$ spectral lines were classified into three morphological classes under a unified classification scheme: single emission peak (83.0 \%), double emission peaks (5.6 \%), and P Cygni-type profiles (11.5 \%), which encompass both P Cygni and inverse P Cygni features. Through cross-referencing with SIMBAD, 39\,497 stars represent new emission-line sources discovered in our research.

Abstract: Despite progress in the observations of stellar magnetic fields, their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. During the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase, the inner layers of stars contract and a radiative core gradually develops. In contrast, the convective envelope is gradually braked through magnetic interactions with the accretion disk and winds. With developing differential rotation inside the star, PMS phase is thus a critical period for magnetic properties of stars when strong initial dipoles can get perturbed, leading to the observed diversity in the magnetism on the main sequence (MS). In this work, we study the impact of differential rotation on such fields. We perform three-dimensional anelastic convective dynamo simulations of rotating spherical shells with an imposed differential rotation (shear) between the boundaries. Density, gravity profiles and convective zone thicknesses were set close to those predicted in PMS low-mass stars by one-dimensional stellar evolution code Cesam2k20. Our results show that radial differential rotation can induce dipole collapse leading to weaker, oscillatory magnetic fields. Differential rotation seems to perturb $α^2$ dynamo mechanism, responsible for dipolar magnetic fields, by shearing poloidal field lines and by affecting turbulent magnetic transport processes. This collapse is moderated by the relative importance of shear compared to the vigor of convective motions, with exact stability criterion depending on the field strength and the size of the radiative core. Applying DNS-based stability criterion in PMS stellar evolution models, we qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the magnetic topologies of low-mass stars when assuming an efficient internal angular momentum redistribution. This suggests that stellar magnetic properties are intimately related to the PMS angular momentum evolution.

Motivation: 旨在通过高红移宇宙剪切研究宇宙学问题，尤其是在物质主导时代和暗能量主导时代的过渡时期，揭示宇宙加速膨胀的奥秘。

Method: 提出采用‘运动学透镜’（KL）技术，结合下一代光谱仪，对高红移星系进行剪切测量。

Result: KL技术的信噪比在红移2至5范围内平均是当前WL巡天（如Euclid或LSST）的2倍，是DES和KiDS等上一代WL巡天的数倍。

Conclusion: KL技术为宇宙学家提供了在空前宇宙体积内联合分析星系成团性和宇宙剪切的机会，有助于深入理解结构增长和暗能量效应。

Abstract: We present a science case to perform high-redshift cosmic shear surveys for cosmology with next-generation spectroscopic instruments, such as the proposed MegaMapper and Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope. We argue that by using the novel technique called 'kinematic lensing' (KL) it will be possible to obtain shear catalogues at redshifts between 2 and 5. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of KL at such high redshifts is on average twice as much that expected from current weak lensing (WL) surveys such as Euclid or LSST, and several times that of the previous generation of WL surveys like DES and KiDS, even with very conservative assumptions about the fraction of spectroscopically-detected sources for which KL shear estimates will be available. This will allow cosmologists to perform joint galaxy clustering-cosmic shear analyses over unprecedented cosmic volumes and to probe the growth of structures deep in the matter-dominated era and across the onset of dark-energy domination, offering a unique opportunity to unveil the mystery of cosmic acceleration.

Motivation: 探索变光速宇宙学对晚期加速运动学的影响，以及与ΛCDM模型的对比。

Method: 基于Dolgov的幂律宇宙学和Barrow的变光速模型，修正红移公式，分析Pantheon Ia型超新星数据。

Result: 模型与观测数据拟合良好，并发现一个显著简并关系$(1+ζ)μ=1$，揭示了光速特性的新特性。

Conclusion: 新模型为晚期加速、地平问题等提供了新的解释，并提出了一个适用于宇宙学的新的共形平坦度规。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the kinematics of late-time acceleration within Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^μ$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-ζ}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying $c$ along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+ζ)}$. The model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of Type Ia supernovae and exhibits a notable degeneracy along the locus $(1+ζ)\,μ=1$. This empirical relation indicates that $c=μ^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is not present in the $Λ$CDM model. We will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of (i) late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology.

Conclusion: 该模型为相互作用暗能量提供了微观物理基础，并严格限制了暗物质与暗能量的湮灭截面，表明其相对宇宙膨胀率高度抑制。

Abstract: The observational tension regarding the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) has motivated the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios, including Interacting Dark Energy models. However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\propto Hρ$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a "bottom-up" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\proptoρ^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A < 7.586\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B < 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units.

Method: 使用多尺度宇宙结构查找算法划分环境，应用标记相关函数分析Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$模拟数据，并与CMASS和DESI模拟样本对比。

Result: 修正引力在节点和细丝中影响更强，环境信息（尤其是细丝）显著提升信噪比和信息含量（约两倍）。

Conclusion: 环境信息（特别是细丝）能有效增强星系聚类测试对修正引力的约束能力。

Abstract: We study environment-dependent clustering using the marked correlation function applied to Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ modified gravity simulations. This gravity theory enriches the structure formation by enhancing gravity in a scale-dependent form. By employing a multi-scale cosmic structure finder algorithm, we define the cosmic environments divided in: nodes, filaments, walls and voids. We find a stronger impact of modified gravity in nodes and filament, which together dominate the information content by more than a factor of four relative to other environments. Combining environmental information further enhances the expected signal-to-noise ratio for CMASS- and DESI-like mock samples, particularly in configurations including filaments. Overall, marked correlation functions that incorporate environmental structure increase the information content by about a factor of two compared to standard density-based marks applied to the full galaxy sample. These results demonstrate the importance of environmental information, especially from filaments, in improving the constraining power of galaxy clustering tests of modified gravity.

Abstract: The linear point, a purely geometric feature in the monopole of the two-point correlation function, has been proposed as an alternative standard ruler. Compared to the peak in the correlation function, it is more robust to late-time nonlinear effects at the percent level. In light of improved simulations and high quality data, we revisit the robustness of the linear point and use it as an alternative to template-based fitting approaches typically used in BAO analyses. We present the linear point measurements on galaxy samples from the first and second data releases (DR1 and DR2) of the DESI survey. We convert the linear point into a dimensionless parameter $α_{iso,LP}$, defined as the ratio of the linear point in the fiducial cosmology and the observed value, analogous to the isotropic BAO scaling parameter $α_{iso}$ used in previous BAO measurements. Using the 2nd generation of AbacusSummit mock catalogs, we find that linear point measurements are more precise when calculated in the post-reconstruction regime with 15-60% smaller uncertainties than those pre-reconstruction. We find a systematic shift in the linear point measurements compared against the isotropic BAO measurements in mocks; we attribute this to the isotropic damping parameter responsible for smearing the linear point in the nonlinear regime. We propose a sample-dependent correction that mitigates the impact of late-time nonlinear effects. While this introduces a cosmology dependence in an otherwise model-independent measurement, this is necessary given the sub-percent precision dictated by current cosmological surveys. Comparing $α_{iso,LP}$ with isotropic BAO measurements made on the DESI DR1 and DR2 galaxy samples, we find excellent agreement after applying this correction, particularly post-reconstruction. We discuss future scope regarding cosmological inference with linear point measurements.

Abstract: Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.

Method: 研究结合了明亮标准警报分析和弱引力透镜效应，模拟了ET（Einstein Telescope）和LISA（Laser Interferometer Space Antenna）探测器在不同观测条件下的性能。

Result: ET探测器在观测300个中子星双星及其电磁对应体的情况下，可以实现对σ₈的10%精度测量；而LISA探测器在观测12个大质量黑洞双星及其电磁对应体时，对σ₈的测量精度为30%。

Conclusion: 通过引入弱引力透镜效应，明亮标准警报分析能够扩展至测量σ₈等宇宙结构相关参数，为未来引力波宇宙学研究提供了新的潜力。

Abstract: Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram. We demonstrate that incorporating weak lensing into bright standard siren analyses allows measurements of cosmological parameters that do not influence the mean luminosity distance-redshift relation but do impact the cosmic structures. In particular, we examine the prospects for measuring the standard deviation of matter perturbations $σ_8$, in addition to the Hubble constant and the matter abundance. We find that a $10\%$ measurement of $σ_8$ would be feasible with ET, provided a population of $300$ neutron star binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed. With LISA, the measurement of $σ_8$ would have $30\%$ accuracy, assuming a population of $12$ massive black hole binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed.

Abstract: We report the successful detection of the "Arid" Meteor Shower (IAU\#1130 ARD), predicted to emerge for the first time in 2021, using a publicly accessible YouTube live camera developed by us. This live camera, installed on the Subaru Telescope dome in the summit region of Maunakea, Hawai'i, features a wide field of view (70 deg by 40 deg) and high sensitivity, capable of observing stars fainter than 6th magnitude. Meteor detection was performed in two ways: visual inspection by citizen viewers and subsequent validation through automated detection. As a result, we confirmed that the number of meteors appearing from near the predicted radiant increased by more than six times (~9 sigma) compared to the preceding and following days. Our observation time was 4-5 hours after the predicted peak (solar longitude = 193.9 deg), providing clear data indicating that the activity had not yet declined. Optical observations at this time from the Northern Hemisphere are extremely limited and unique, making our observation point valuable. The meteors are characterized as slow and faint appearance, but several brighter meteors with wakes were also observed. Simulations tracing the dust trails from the parent body, Comet 15P/Finlay, suggest that our detection can be explained by either the dust trails released in 2008 or 2014, both requiring high ejection velocities. However, during the comet's 2008 return, its activity was exceptionally quiet, making a high-velocity dust ejection questionable. On the other hand, multiple large outbursts were observed during the 2014 return, at which time a certain amount of high-velocity dust release is expected. We conclude that the dust source of the meteor shower detected in Hawai'i this time is likely attributable to high-velocity (~67 m s-1) dust ejected during the 2014 outburst.

Abstract: The abundances of atmospheric carbon species--carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)--exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.

Motivation: 研究偏心双星系统周围极地对齐盘的形成及其动力学效应，以理解其对双星轨道演化和相关天体物理过程（如行星形成和黑洞合并）的影响。

Method: 使用平滑粒子流体动力学（Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, SPH）模拟，在质量注入条件下演化近似稳态，分析不同双星-盘参数下极地对齐盘的双星轨道演化。

Result: 在所有模拟案例中，双星轨道随时间收缩。极地对齐盘导致的收缩速率高于对齐盘或逆行进盘的情况。收缩速率几乎不受双星吸积半径大小影响，但在小吸积半径情况下，部分模型会出现长期存在的极地环绕主星盘。

Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.

Motivation: 研究巨行星和褐矮星伴星的自转特性差异，以揭示其形成过程中角动量演化的不同机制。

Method: 使用Keck/KPIC高分辨率光谱测量32个天体的自转速度，并结合文献数据构建样本，比较其自转速度与角动量演化关系。

Result: 巨行星的自转速度显著高于褐矮星伴星（4-4.5σ显著性）；褐矮星伴星的自转速度低于孤立褐矮星；行星和行星质量天体的自转相似。

Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $σ$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $σ$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.

Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.

Conclusion: GALFITools通过自动化任务显著提升了星系图像建模的工作效率，为相关研究提供了更便捷的工具。

Abstract: Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires measuring their light distributions in images taken by telescopes. This process often involves fitting mathematical models to galaxy images to extract properties such as size, brightness, components, and shape. GALFIT is a widely used tool for this purpose, but it requires careful preparation of input files and interpretation of results, which can be a barrier to efficient use. GALFITools is a Python library that streamlines this workflow by automating many of the tasks surrounding the use of GALFIT. These include generating image masks, estimating sky background, modeling the telescope's point spread function (PSF), and extracting physical parameters from GALFIT outputs. The software is designed for researchers and students who work with galaxy image modeling and aims to make the process more reproducible, accessible, and scalable.

Abstract: We report the Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS) as a new tool to model the growth of realistic nanosized dust grains through the progressive accretion of monomers onto a nucleated seed. NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models.

Abstract: High-precision photometric standard stars play a key role in enabling accurate photometric calibration and advancing various fields of astronomy. However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决HWO设计中曝光时间计算的简化假设问题，即忽略残差衍射星光的斑驳性（speckles），并探索这种斑驳性是否可能通过光子噪声限制的speckles减除提高观测灵敏度。

Method: 通过角差分成像（ADI）这一观测策略，分析结合两个观测滚动角度的数据对信噪比的提升效果。

Result: 结果表明，当斑驳性星光主导其他噪声源时，结合两个观测角度的数据可使信噪比增益超过√2；若星光噪声占比更高，增益可接近2倍。

Conclusion: 文章得出结论，结合噪声水平不同的观测数据（如好与坏的观测）优于结合两个平均质量的观测，这一结论适用于任何噪声水平变化的观测数据组合。

Abstract: The data post-processing gain is an important parameter for exposure time calculations used to inform the design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level.

Abstract: Despite early theoretical expectations that large-scale, massive outflows would be triggered by accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, their presence was not firmly established until the 2000s. Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities.

*Matt Nicholl*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: PTF12dam SLSN exhibits changing O II absorption profiles during its rise to maximum light, suggesting spectroscopic diversity is linked to ejecta temperature rather than explosion differences. A new diagnostic and model explain light curve diversity via ejected mass variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the diversity in spectroscopic and photometric properties of Type I SLSNe to uncover underlying physical mechanisms, such as ejecta temperature or progenitor differences.

Method: Analyzed PTF12dam's spectroscopic evolution, developed a Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and proposed a toy model for photospheric velocity evolution.

Result: Light curve rise time variations naturally explain differences in O II line strength and photospheric velocity evolution, supporting a flat ejecta density profile.

Conclusion: Spectroscopic diversity in SLSNe arises primarily from ejecta temperature dynamics, with a central engine-inflated hot bubble fitting observed ejecta properties.

Abstract: Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.

Conclusion: 论文支持“膝”现象主要由局部源贡献的解释，强调了近距离高能天体（如Cygnus Cocoon）的重要性。

Abstract: A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.

Abstract: Despite the growing number of high-energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV) detected by IceCube, their astrophysical origins remain largely unidentified. Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $<$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b>5\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos.

Conclusion: 改进的Gum Nebula模型和新技术提高了脉冲星距离估计的可靠性，减少了对银河电子密度分布模型不确定性的依赖。

Abstract: Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.

Motivation: 探索无线电观测数据在无需明确重建簇射最大深度（$X_{max}$）的情况下，是否仍能通过其对EAS纵向发展的敏感性实现初级质量区分，这对GRAND等纯无线电实验尤为重要。

Method: 采用随机森林（RF）监督机器学习算法，以峰值电场、频谱斜率及天线到簇射轴的距离作为输入特征，利用RDSim框架生成的大规模事件集进行训练和测试。

Result: 在研究的仰角范围内，即使对每个簇射进行电磁能量归一化，区分准确率仍达到81%至96%，这些结果是保守上限。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅基于无线电观测数据的事件级别初级质量区分在原则上是可行的。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.

Abstract: Blazars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets pointed at the observer, exhibit flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum due to particle acceleration in their jets. Power spectral density (PSD) studies show breaks at specific frequencies, particularly in X-rays, linked to the accretion regime and black hole mass. However, very-high-energy gamma-ray PSD breaks remain unexplored due to current instrument limitations. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with up to ten times greater sensitivity compared to current generation instruments, will allow precise PSD reconstruction and unprecedented study of blazar flares. These flares reveal key insights into particle acceleration, photon production, and jet properties. The AGN monitoring and flare programs in CTAO's Key Science Project aim to deepen our understanding of blazar emissions.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 本文研究了IRAS 04166的喷流状高速气体（EHV）与低速流出气体之间的关系，通过ALMA观测和弹道模型分析发现EHV气体在加速低速气体中发挥作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IRAS 04166流出气体中EHV组分与慢速流出气体的关系，以理解其物理连接和相互作用机制。

Method: 使用ALMA的12m和紧凑阵列对CO(2-1)发射进行拼接观测，并开发弹道模型解释数据。

Result: EHV气体由一系列弧状凝结物组成，与慢速流出气体物理连接；弹道模型成功模拟了EHV气体与慢速气体的相互作用。

Conclusion: EHV气体在加速慢速气体中起重要作用，该机制可能也存在于其他系统中。

Abstract: $Context.$ The outflow from the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706 (hereafter IRAS 04166) contains a remarkably symmetric jet-like component of extremely high-velocity (EHV) gas.
  $Aims.$ We studied the IRAS 04166 outflow and investigated the relation between its EHV component and the slower outflow gas.
  $Methods.$ We mosaicked the CO(2--1) emission from the IRAS 04166 outflow using the 12m and the Compact Arrays of ALMA. We also developed a ballistic toy model of the gas ejected laterally from a jet to interpret the data.
  $Results.$ In agreement with previous observations, the ALMA data show that the slow outflow component is distributed in two opposed conical lobes and has a shear-flow pattern with velocity increasing toward the axis. The EHV gas consists of a series of arc-like condensations that span the full width of the conical lobes and merge with their walls, suggesting that the fast and slow outflow components are physically connected. In addition, position--velocity diagrams along the outflow axis show finger-like extensions that connect the EHV emission with the origin of the diagram, as if part of the EHV gas had been decelerated by its interaction with the low-velocity outflow. A ballistic model can reproduce these finger-like extensions assuming that the EHV gas consists of jet material that has been ejected laterally over a short period of time and has transferred part of its momentum to the surrounding shear flow.
  $Conclusions.$ The EHV gas in the IRAS 04166 outflow seems to play a role in the acceleration of the slower gas component. The presence of similar finger-like extensions in the position-velocity diagrams of other outflows suggests that this process may be occurring in other systems, even if the EHV component is not seen because it has an atomic composition.

Abstract: Multiwavelength observations, from radio to X-rays, have revealed the presence of multiphase high-velocity gas near the center of the Milky Way likely associated with powerful galactic outflows. This region offers a unique laboratory to study the physics of feedback and the nature of multiphase winds in detail. To this end, we have developed physically motivated semi-analytical models of a multiphase outflow consisting of a hot gas phase ($T \gg 10^6$ K) that embeds colder clouds ($T \sim 5000$ K). Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases. Using Bayesian inference, we compared the predictions of our models with observations of a population of HI high-velocity clouds detected up to $\sim$1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane near the Galactic center. We find that a class of supernova-driven winds launched by star formation in the central molecular zone can successfully reproduce the observed velocities, spatial distribution, and masses of the clouds. In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling. However, this interaction also leads to gradual cloud disruption, with smaller clouds losing over 70\% of their initial mass by the time they reach $\sim$2 kpc.

Conclusion: 结果表明，AGN在宇宙再电离过程中可能扮演了比之前估计的更重要的角色。

Abstract: Reionization marks one of the most important phase transitions in the history of the Universe, during which neutral baryonic matter was transformed into ionized plasma. While star-forming galaxies are widely regarded as the primary drivers of this process, the extent to which active galactic nuclei (AGNs) contribute remains a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we integrate a physically motivated AGN spectral energy distribution (SED) model with state-of-the-art observations to reassess the contribution of AGNs to cosmic reionization. Our findings indicate that adopting a more sophisticated AGN SED model could substantially increase the predicted ionizing photon output by a factor of 3$\sim$4, elevating AGNs to a more significant role ($\approx$20\%) in maintaining reionization than previously estimated. The inclusion of abundant faint AGNs further amplifies this contribution by a factor of a few. These conclusions remain robust across a wide range of accretion rates and ionizing photon escape fractions. Collectively, our results suggest that AGNs may have played a more prominent and previously underestimated role in the reionization of the Universe.

Conclusion: 研究表明，高红移星系外围环境中可高效形成致密星团，为连接早期星系外围星团、现代球状星团及大质量黑洞种子提供了一条可能的演化路径。

Abstract: The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at $z > 6$, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between $\sim$$10^{8}$ - $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z > 7$, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.

Conclusion: N-PDF是诊断分子云演化阶段和星形成阈值的有用统计工具，揭示了Cygnus-X的物理状态。

Abstract: The density distribution within molecular clouds offers critical insights into their underlying physical processes, which are essential for understanding star formation. As a statistical measure of column density on the cloud scale, the shape and evolution of the column density probability density function (N-PDF) serve as important tools for understanding the dynamics between turbulence and gravity. Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds.

Abstract: As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.

Conclusion: 更多FRB数据有助于提高DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$的测量精度，未来需关注个别FRB的影响。

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the electron column density along the line of sight and hence can be used to probe foreground structures. One such structure is the Galactic halo. In this work, we use a total of 98 high Galactic latitude ($|b| > 20^\circ$) FRBs detected by ASKAP, Parkes, DSA and FAST with 32 associated redshifts to constrain the dispersion measure (DM) contribution from the Galactic halo. We simultaneously fit unknown FRB population parameters, which show correlations with the Galactic halo but are not completely degenerate. We primarily use an isotropic model for the halo, but find no evidence favouring a particular halo model. We find DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$=$68^{+27}_{-24}$pc/cm$^3$, which is in agreement with other results within the literature. Previous constraints on DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$ with FRBs have used a few, low-DM FRBs. However, this is highly subject to fluctuations between different lines of sight, and hence using a larger number of sightlines as we do is more likely to be representative of the true average contribution. Nevertheless, we show that individual FRBs can still skew the data significantly and hence will be important in the future for more precise results.

Abstract: Rejuvenating galaxies are important probes of galaxy evolution, yet identifying them observationally is challenging as constraining recent star formation histories requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\sim\!100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$α$ (tracing $\sim\!10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$α$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$α$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\lesssim\!20\,M_\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\sim\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\sim\!4.5\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于银河中心分子区（CMZ）距离远且前景消光严重，对红外冰吸收特征的化学和演化特性解释困难，需更好地表征该区域的年轻恒星体（YSOs）和稠密核心。

Method: 结合多颗YSOs的光谱（可能被巨星背光），使用Gemini/GNIRS获取15个极红点源的L波段光谱，测量3.535微米的CH3OH吸收特征，并结合K波段和中红外光谱约束前景消光与H2O冰柱密度。

Result: 甲醇冰在CH3OH-CO2混合物中丰度为2-5%，显著低于银河盘典型值；在包层内部区域，甲醇相对固态CO2丰度约10%，而在外层急剧增至30%。

Conclusion: 低甲醇冰丰度可能源于CMZ的独特化学环境，或由样本偏向大质量高光度YSOs导致的内层甲醇冰升华。结果为CMZ区域星际化学研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains a substantial reservoir of dense molecular gas, where numerous young stellar objects (YSOs) and dense cloud cores have been identified. However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios.

Abstract: The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe. These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.

Abstract: We present a milliarcsecond-resolution radio survey of 17 high-redshift (4 < z < 5.4) blazar candidates observed with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network at 5 GHz. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the nature of these distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and to confirm their blazar nature. Utilizing the technique of VLBI, we obtained high-resolution radio images of compact core and core-jet structures. To confirm the classification of these sources, we collected multi-band archival data, including total radio flux densities from single-dish and low-resolution interferometric surveys, optical astrometric positions from Gaia, and X-ray data. These diagnostics collectively help distinguish between blazars and misaligned jetted AGN. We were able to measure the core brightness temperatures and found that 11 objects show the Doppler-boosted emission expected from blazars. For five additional sources, we do not see evidence of Doppler boosting even if X-ray data suggest that the source is a blazar. These could be either borderline objects or variability may have affected the classifications, considering that VLBI and X-ray data are not simultaneous. Finally, for the two remaining objects the data suggest a non-blazar classification. Our findings confirm that a significant fraction of these high-redshift radio-loud quasars are blazars and mainly characterized by compact core structures. Overall, the VLBI classifcations are consistent with the X-ray classes. This study further increases the sample of VLBI-imaged radio quasars at z > 4 by ~10%, offering valuable on the population of AGN in the early Universe.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在10至60K温度下，CH3与OH自由基在非晶态固态水（冰尘类似物）表面的反应，验证了即使在10K低温下也能通过CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O和CH3 + OH -> CH3OH的连续反应生成甲醇，并提出CH3的瞬态扩散是反应的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管甲醇可能在星际冰尘上通过氢化反应形成，但CH3与OH自由基在高于20K温度下的反应是否生成甲醇尚未通过实验验证。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探索低温下自由基反应的机制。

Method: 采用新型Cs+离子拾取技术，在10至60K温度范围内，利用紫外光解水分子生成OH自由基，随后在冰基底上沉积甲烷气体（CH4），观察CH3与OH的反应过程。

Result: 实验证实，即使在10K低温下，CH3OH也能通过两步反应生成（CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O；CH3 + OH -> CH3OH），且反应中CH3的瞬态扩散（由第一步反应的热量驱动）是关键。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低温星际环境中自由基反应生成甲醇的可行性，强调了瞬态扩散在表面反应中的作用，为星际化学过程提供了新见解。

Abstract: Methanol (CH3OH) is thought to form on interstellar ice dust via successive hydrogenation reactions. The reaction between CH3 and OH radicals could also conceivably generate methanol at temperatures above approximately 20 K, at which temperature hydrogen atoms will not adhere to the ice surface. However, this process has not been verified by well-controlled experiments. Using a newly-developed Cs+ ion pickup technique, the authors investigated the reaction between CH3 and OH radicals on the surface of amorphous solid water, an ice dust analogue, at temperatures from 10 to 60 K. In the present experiments, OH radicals were generated by UV photolysis of water molecules, following which methane (CH4) gas was deposited on the ice substrate. The results show that CH3OH was formed on the ice surface through the sequential reactions CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O and CH3 + OH -> CH3OH even at 10 K. Considering the very low surface coverage of reactants in the experimental condition, the second reaction was found to occur as a result of transient diffusion of CH3 due to the heat of the first reaction.

Conclusion: 吸积盘尺寸可能接近基准尺寸，不支持BLR形成的辐射失败的尘埃驱动外流模型。

Abstract: The structure of the accretion disk in AGN is still an unsolved question, especially how it may change with Eddington ratio. Here we examine the accretion disk in the super-Eddington AGN I Zw 1 using reverberation mapping of the optical continuum. We use three years of optical monitoring with Las Cumbres Observatory at sub-day cadence in $uBgVriz_s$. The lag-wavelength spectrum, calculated using the cross correlation method and PyROA, shows a $u$-band excess. PyROA lags are equally well fitted with a thin and slim disk profile. The UV/optical AGN spectral energy distribution is consistent with a thin disk. The disk size at 4495 Å for a thin disk model is $4.23\pm0.24\:\mathrm{ld}$ and for a slim disk model is $1.71\pm0.09\:\mathrm{ld}$, larger by a factor of $2-4$ than the fiducial disk size of $1.07\pm0.15\:\mathrm{ld}$ as determined using the Eddington ratio. We find evidence of different size scales probed with different variability timescales. Lags evaluated at longer variability timescales increase as do frequency-resolved lags at low frequencies, which we interpret as an additional secondary reprocessor at large radii consistent with the broad-line region (BLR) in I Zw 1. The high frequency lags, predicted well with just a disk, are fit with a thin disk profile and a size of $0.61\pm0.37\:\mathrm{ld}$. This indicates that the actual disk size may be on the order of the fiducial size. We also collate the most extensive set of directly measured internal sizes of an AGN, from optical to mid-infrared with reverberation mapping and optical interferometry. Assuming that the disk is indeed the fiducial size, these show little evidence that the accretion disk extends into the BLR significantly, tentatively disfavouring the failed radiatively accelerated dust driven outflow BLR formation model.

TL;DR: 论文通过模拟研究高红移星系中恒星形成率（SFR）推断的系统性偏差，发现不同示踪方法（Hα、[CII]、IR、UV + IR）的表现受尘埃衰减、视角等因素影响，IR和混合方法更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高红移星系中恒星形成率的准确推断存在挑战，既有观测限制，也有校准方法的不确定性。本研究旨在通过模拟揭示这些系统性偏差及其来源。

Method: 利用NewHorizon和NewCluster两个流体力学模拟，结合辐射传输代码Skirt生成合成观测数据，分析Hα、[CII]、IR和混合（IR + UV）示踪方法的性能。

Result: Hα推断的SFR受校准选择和尘埃衰减影响显著；IR方法在100 Myr时间尺度上更准确，但受限于数据覆盖；混合方法更稳健；[CII]-SFR关系较陡，但散射大。

Conclusion: IR、混合和[CII]示踪方法比Hα更稳健，但仍需考虑系统偏差。研究为高红移星系SFR推断提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Inferring the star formation rates (SFR) in high redshift galaxies remains challenging, owing to observational limitations or uncertainties in calibration methods that link luminosities to SFRs. We utilize two state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon and NewCluster, post-processed with the radiative transfer code Skirt, to investigate the systematic uncertainties and biases in the inferred SFRs for z=5 galaxies; an epoch where galaxies build-up their stellar mass. We create synthetic observables for widely-used tracers: Halpha nebular line, [CII] 158 micron fine-structure line, total infrared (IR) continuum luminosity, and hybrid (IR + UV). We find that Halpha-inferred SFRs, time-averaged over 10 Myr, are sensitive to the choice of calibration and exhibit substantial scatter driven by dust attenuation, viewing angle, and dust-to-metal ratio. Adopting a steeper attenuation curve reduces this scatter significantly but does not fully eliminate systematic uncertainties. IR continuum-based SFRs trace intrinsic SFRs time-averaged over 100 Myr timescales when a well-sampled continuum emission between restframe 8 and 1000 micron is available and underestimate them with typical approaches when IR data are limited. Nevertheless, IR SFRs display a considerable scatter, largely due to UV photon leakage and strong variations in the star formation history. When UV data are available, hybrid (IR + UV) SFRs provide a more robust estimate, reducing scatter compared to IR-based SFRs while avoiding explicit attenuation corrections. Finally, we derive a [CII]-SFR relation finding a steeper relation than previous studies, however with significant scatter linked to gas density and metallicity. Overall, IR-, hybrid-, and [CII]-based tracers remain more robust than Halpha against variations in optical depth.

### [54] [Ultra Diffuse Galaxies in clusters : the peculiar gas loss of VCC 1964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05948)
*Rhys Taylor,Vojtech Partík,Robert Minchin*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: UDG VCC 1964 shows a gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters a cluster, with a significant HI-optical offset and dark matter deficit, possibly due to disturbed equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the evolution and dynamics of Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in clusters, especially how they differ from field UDGs, is key to uncovering their formation and gas loss mechanisms.

Method: Using Arecibo surveys (AGES and WAVES) to measure HI gas content, combined with optical data from SDSS and DESI Legacy Surveys, to analyze VCC 1964.

Result: VCC 1964 exhibits a 9 kpc HI-optical offset, no HI asymmetry, and modest gas deficiency. Its dynamics deviate significantly from Tully-Fisher relations, suggesting a dark matter deficit.

Conclusion: VCC 1964 is likely a UDG undergoing first-time cluster entry with ram pressure displacing gas. The dark matter deficit may be real or due to disturbed gas equilibrium.

Abstract: Context : Ultra Diffuse Galaxies are low surface brightness systems which have been detected in HI in the field, where their line widths sometimes indicate significant dark matter deficits. They are rarely detected in HI in clusters, making their dynamical properties difficult to assess. The relation between field and cluster populations is unclear.
  Aims : Detecting UDGs entering a cluster could give important clues to their evolution, both in terms of their dynamics but also as to whether they are structurally similar - i.e. if cluster UDGs are generally the same as field UDGs except with less gas and an older stellar population.
  Methods : We use data from two deep Arecibo surveys, the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey and the Widefield Arecibo Virgo Environment Survey, to measure the gas content of the UDG-candidate VCC 1964. Optical properties are quantified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Surveys.
  Results : We find a significant 9 kpc offset between the HI and optical components of VCC 1964, no evidence of asymmetry in the HI, and only a modest deficiency level. This suggests a wholesale displacement of the gas content. The line width is 4-5 sigma deviant from the baryonic and over 6 sigma deviant from the optical forms of the Tully-Fisher relation. The optical component is blue and smooth.
  Conclusions : VCC 1964 is consistent with a UDG experiencing gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters the cluster for the first time. Intriguingly, its dynamics imply a significant dark matter deficit, however we cannot rule out that this may be due to the gas being displaced out of equilibrium.

TL;DR: 研究人员在PLCKG004.5-10.5星系团后方的$z\sim7$强透镜星系中发现了一对微弱的红色小点（LRDs），命名为Red Eyes。这对LRDs在图像平面上可分辨，颜色独特，且在源平面上相距约70pc。它们位于一个典型的恒星形成星系中，但自身紫外辐射极弱。研究表明，类似Red Eyes的多重偏移LRDs可能普遍隐藏在典型的高红移恒星形成星系中，可能与中等质量黑洞（IMBHs）的形成和中央超大质量黑洞的增长有关。

Motivation: 探索高红移星系中是否存在多重LRDs，并研究其起源及其对星系中心超大质量黑洞增长的潜在贡献。

Method: 利用JWST VENUS项目的观测数据，识别位于$z\sim7$强透镜星系中的Red Eyes，分析其空间分布、颜色特征、亮度以及与宿主星系的关系。

Result: Red Eyes是一对在源平面上相距70pc的LRDs，位于恒星形成星系的边缘而非中心。其紫外辐射极弱，但在强透镜作用下可分辨。研究推测类似LRDs可能普遍存在于高红移星系中，可能与IMBHs相关。

Conclusion: 类似Red Eyes的多重LRDs可能普遍隐藏在高红移恒星形成星系中，支持IMBHs通过合并促进中央超大质量黑洞增长的假说。

Abstract: We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at $z\sim7$ behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $μ\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\mathrm{UV,int}}\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV,int}} \gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 7$ with $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{4\text{--}6}\,M_\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.
