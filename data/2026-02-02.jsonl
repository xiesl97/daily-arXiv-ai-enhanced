However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($<100 \\rm \\ pc$) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim 2\\times10^5 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ black holes residing in $M_\\star \\gtrsim 2\\times10^7 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ galaxies."}

Submitted to A&A, comments are welcome", "summary": "The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta -- indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight -- but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties."}

See Figures 3 and 4 for main results and Figure 5 for interpretation", "summary": "The orientation of radio jets relative to their host galaxies offers an interesting avenue for probing the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their surroundings. Several studies have also investigated the orientation of nuclear dust features. We follow up on this previous work with newer Hubble Space Telescope imaging of early-type radio galaxies, and a largely automated process for measuring position angles. We classify the dust features as lanes, disks, or rings. Lanes are irregular structures that likely form from gas-rich minor mergers, while disks and rings are more well-defined and may form from settling lanes or internal mechanisms. We find that dust lanes do not have a preferred alignment relative to their host galaxies, but are preferentially perpendicular to the jets. In contrast, dust disks and rings tend to be closely aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies, but have varying orientations relative to the jets. Our results suggest that infalling dusty material from mergers can influence the angle of the radio jet. This would allow the jet orientation to change over time, and may help explain the role of AGN feedback in maintaining quiescence in massive galaxies."}

This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $λ$ Boötis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($>$5 M$_\\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $λ$ Boötis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $λ$ Boötis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($>100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $λ$ Boötis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns."}

They represent extreme examples of misaligned systems and provide valuable insight into galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and peculiar gas dynamics. We compile a complete sample of kinematically confirmed PRGs and collect their H I measurements. Combining literature data with new observations from FAST, we detect H I emission in 22 sources, identify one potential H I absorption feature, and find four non-detections among 40 confirmed PRGs. Compared to galaxies in the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, PRGs predominantly occupy the green valley or quenched regimes but exhibit higher gas fractions than typical early-type galaxies, suggesting gas accretion. The H I profile asymmetry and shape for PRGs are not consistent with that of the ALFALFA sample with p<0.05. We examine their Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and baryonic TFR (bTFR), linking the systems' rotation velocities to their masses. The extreme outliers in TFRs for the control sample tend to display single-peaked H I profiles. PRGs do not follow a tight TFR or bTFR if the H I resides primarily in the host galaxy. But the scatter decreases significantly if we assume the gas is mainly distributed in the polar ring. Spatially resolved H I observations are essential to disentangle the gas distribution and kinematics in PRGs, which are key to understanding their formation mechanisms."}

RW Aur A as a case study", "comment": "21 pages, 31 figures, accepted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Stellar fly-bys can have multiple dynamical effects on protoplanetary disks, including warping and the excitation of spiral arms. Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5° can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable."}

It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario\". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\\rm PBH} \\ll M_{\\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \\simeq M_{\\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario\" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events."}

No figures", "summary": "We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $Λ$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $σ_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $Λ$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter."}

Most (94 percent) GOODS AGN exhibit obscured SEDs, defined by diminished ultraviolet and/or mid-infrared emission, while only 6 percent show unobscured, quasar-like SEDs. Secular processes appear to play a large role in stimulating AGN emission, as only around one-third of galaxies are undergoing interactions.

Our findings are in general agreement with earlier studies that suggest magnetic deflection angles > 90 degrees are very unlikely to occur in sub-Alfvenic regimes. We find that their upper limit exhibits an identifiable trend with the Alfven Mach number Ma, suggesting that gradual steepening of Alfvenic deflections with increasing Ma is a plausible mechanism controlling deflection angles in the young solar wind. Further analysis reveals that large velocity fluctuations tend to be important in the largest sub-Alfvenic magnetic deflections with increasing contributions from the parallel component very close to Ma = 1, while virtually no magnetic deflections in the super-Alfvenic regime exhibit such large velocity perturbations. We also determine the local ratio of radial Poynting flux SR to kinetic energy flux KR and find that large sub-Alfvenic deflection angles tend to be dominated by SR, while super-Alfvenic deflections are eventually dominated by the KR associated with the radial solar wind flow. Our results show that within the vicinity of the Alfven surface (where Ma = 1), there is a critical region of parameter space within which velocity deflections approach the Alfven velocity and KR/SR is close to unity. We refer to this region (where | log10(Ma)| < 0.2) as the conversion layer.

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \\, σ$ to $2 \\, σ$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods."}

This technique requires high-fidelity measurements of the gas-phase physical conditions, namely the electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$). To this end, we present deep rest-optical spectroscopy for a sample of 62 low-metallicity ($\\lesssim$ 20% solar O/H) galaxies acquired using the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) as part of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project. We discuss new fitting methods that recover the intensity of up to 61 H and He recombination lines, of which, up to 26 will be used to determine gas-phase He abundances, and we examine the emission line properties of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project sample. We assess different scaling relations in the low-metallicity interstellar medium (ISM), finding that $n_e$[Ar IV] measured in 31 targets is systematically larger than $n_e$[S II] or $n_e$[O II]. The larger densities are insufficient to significantly bias $T_e$[O III] or the O/H abundance. $T_e$[S III] and $T_e$[O III] are strongly correlated over a range of $\\sim$10$^4$ K with very low scatter, and we calibrate new $T_e$[S III]-$T_e$[O III] scaling relations for use in other low-metallicity environments. We examine different $T_e$ measured in the low-ionization gas, finding significant scatter compared to $T_e$[O III]. The precision direct O/H derived in this analysis (median uncertainty $\\sim$4%) are consistent with prior literature measurements, albeit with relatively large scatter. These data provide a key component necessary to empirically measure $Y_{\\rm p}$ and the abundance patterns of other elements in the ISM."}

James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\\sim0.1~M\\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\\sim10^{29}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS."}

The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels.

Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores.

Because these two parameters are inherently degenerate when derived solely from H and He recombination lines, we rely on the density-sensitive HeI $λ$10830 line to assist in resolving this issue, especially for accurate He abundances. To facilitate this, we present near-IR (NIR) LUCI spectra of 48 low-metallicity targets from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and homogeneously reduce them using Pypeit as part of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project. IR spectra require special care, and we wavelength calibrate by-hand using the bright OH emission lines, carefully apply proper telluric corrections, and co-add the spectra of LUCI1 and LUCI2 on a resampled grid to ensure accurate results. We use a Gaussian profile to fit the emission lines and measure the fluxes relative to Paschen-gamma (P$γ$), resulting in HeI $λ$10830 to P$γ$ ratios consistent with previous studies. As a result, this work significantly expands the available dataset of NIR HeI $λ$10830 fluxes in low metallicity galaxies. These high-quality measurements, where we find a median flux ratio uncertainty of $\\widetildeσ = 0.08$, reduce the overall uncertainties in helium abundance estimates for individual targets. The increased size of the high-quality sample enables searching for systematic uncertainties and improves the reliability of the helium abundance determinations used to infer the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\\rm p}$)."}

Understanding phenomena such as episodic ejections and outflow asymmetries can thus shed light on the mechanism of jet launching and its connection to both mass accretion and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We use new VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode observations of the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28 to map the jet structures within 6'' of the source at an effective angular resolution of 0.''12, provided by the combination of the AO correction and image deconvolution. The emission line profiles and flux ratios are investigated and diagnostic analysis of the optical forbidden emission lines (FELs) is used to estimate the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and shock velocities in both jet lobes within 200 au of the star. The mass outflow rates in each lobe are obtained using the derived total densities and FEL luminosities and compared with the mass accretion rate. We identify several new knots in both jet lobes which have been ejected in the previous 10 years on a timescale of 3-6 years, which is significantly more frequent than previously estimated. In both lobes we find comparable mass outflow rates close to the jet base. Th 28 has undergone a significant rise in mass accretion rate between 2014 and 2023, which may be linked to the most recently ejected knot pair detected in each side of the jet. The red-shifted jet mass outflow rate shows a similar increase of a factor 2, indicating that the ratio of mass outflow to accretion remains constant. A moderately lower mass outflow rate is found in the faster blue-shifted lobe, supporting the possibility that momentum ejection is conserved on each side of the jet. The frequent knot ejections indicate that this source is a good target for further monitoring to study the accretion-ejection connection."}

Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets."}

In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event.

The comparison with the [NeV]3425A and [FeII]1.257um profiles indicates that [Fe VII] emission likely arises only from the outflow. The absence of the systemic component in [Fe VII] - unlike in [NeV], which has similar ionisation potential and critical density - suggests suppression of [Fe VII] due to iron depletion onto dust grains, while its detection in the outflow implies a lower dust content than in the host ISM.

As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\\sim$10 Myr. With both at 10 wt%, greenhouse warming alone can prolong outgassing up to $\\sim$30 Myr. Our model shows that tidal heating can reduce the volatile threshold required to maintain a high surface temperature ($\\sim$3200 K at $e = 0.005$) and delay outgassing of additional volatiles to the present-day. However, higher tidal heating presents a tradeoff between prolonging tenuous outgassing and enlarging the overall size of the secondary atmosphere. Tidally-enhanced outgassing may produce minor pressure variations that could contribute to the observed phase-curve variability. Additionally, our model shows that tidal heating strongly controls outgassing in the planet's young-to-midlife stage, then shifts toward a volatile inventory dependence at mature ages. Using 55 Cnc e, we present a framework to prioritize atmosphere detections on rocky ultra short period (USP) magma ocean planets, linking age-dependent tidal heating and volatile inventory to the formation and size of secondary atmospheres."}

While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions. We discuss the physical implications of our results and potential future explorations."}

We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass. Our results are consistent with literature findings that suggest median disk lifetimes may be >2x longer than previously thought."}

The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating simultaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement traditional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity > 6 GV. The timing of the prompt and delayed peaks coincided with the proton flux peaks observed by the GOES-18 satellite at energies > 150 MeV and 12-99 MeV, respectively. It is observed that the GLE amplitude has a strong dependence on geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and has a weak solar zenith angle dependence."}

In particular, the near-infrared (NIR) spectral domain offers an increased RV sensitivity and potentially reduced stellar activity signals.

We assessed the impact of telluric contamination and evaluated the performance of the weighted principal component analysis reconstruction method (WAPITI), designed to mitigate these systematics and improve planet detectability.\n  Using synthetic and observational SPIRou data, we simulated telluric effects on RVs under varying barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) conditions and applied WAPITI to correct line-by-line RVs. The method was tested through injection-recovery experiments and applied to real SPIRou observations of Gl 725 B.\n  WAPITI efficiently corrects telluric contamination in simulated and real datasets, enhancing the detectability and accuracy of planetary signals.

Re-submitted to A&A after addressing initial referee comments, comments welcome", "summary": "XRISM has provided an unprecedented view of the emission and absorption lines in the X-ray. Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind."}

Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models."}

We find mixed results using line diagnostics ([OIII]$_{5007}$/H$β$ - [NII]/H$α$ and $σ_{\\rm Hα}$ - [SII]/H$α$) to spatially resolve ionisation mechanisms across the extraplanar gas. The highest [NII]/H$α$ are the extraplanar gas of the highest SFR systems, yet main-sequence galaxies have the highest [OIII]/H$β$. While the morphology of [NII]/H$α$ may be useful to identify outflows, the absolute value of the line ratio alone may not distinguish strong outflows from extraplanar gas of main-sequence galaxies. The ubiquitous extraplanar emission can be interpreted as the result of feedback, in the form of large-scale winds for starbursts or smaller-scale galactic fountains for main-sequence galaxies. Moreover, shock-heating may ionise gas at the interface of the disk and the circumgalactic medium, independent of the source of the gas."}

As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $Λ$LTB model and use it as a set of \"glasses\" through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $Λ$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies.

High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301.

We combined stereoscopic hard X-ray (HXR) observations from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) and the Solar Orbiter/Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) with a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation constrained by observed photospheric magnetic fields. During the two main peaks of the impulsive phase, HXR footpoints appeared at different locations, indicating a migration of the primary reconnection site in the corona. Our data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduced the reconnected field lines linking the observed conjugate HXR footpoints. Furthermore, the simulation shows that these primary reconnections occur along a single quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) system. Therefore, the two main peaks of HXR can be interpreted as episodic energy release within the single QSL system. This study demonstrates that the data-constrained MHD model provides a realistic 3D magnetic context for interpreting HXR emission. Notably, STIX observations revealed a vertically distributed thermal HXR source, extending from the footpoints to the looptop, with its centroid migrating between the two peaks. This marks a first step toward understanding the particle acceleration processes in solar flares."}

We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \\le 61$ and $K_a \\le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group.

Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R < 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$σ$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (< 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (> 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions."}

We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates.

Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.\n  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.\n  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.\n  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.\n  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential."}

As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top.\n  Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae.

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments."}

Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant."}

Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5° can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable."}

In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$.

Accepted to ApJ", "summary": "We present revised stellar ages for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region, derived by using stellar dynamical masses to constrain isochronal ages from five pre-main sequence stellar evolutionary models. We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass. Our results are consistent with literature findings that suggest median disk lifetimes may be >2x longer than previously thought."}

In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($Λ$CDM, $ω$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\\geq10^{4}M_{\\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\\geq 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ contributes $\\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied.

Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.\n  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.\n  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.\n  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.\n  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential."}

To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $Γ$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1. These results highlight the universality of physical processes involved in massive star formation across a range of Galactic environments."}

To facilitate this, we present near-IR (NIR) LUCI spectra of 48 low-metallicity targets from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and homogeneously reduce them using Pypeit as part of the LBT $Y_{\\rm p}$ Project.

To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy. Our study provides a blueprint for leveraging contrastive methods to mine forthcoming survey data for faint tidal substructure, and highlights key preprocessing and interpretability considerations for robust stream detection."}

James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\\sim0.1~M\\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\\sim10^{29}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS."}

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($β= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\\circ$ case at $β= 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows.

We investigate the consistency of these observations within a data-driven framework that links the galaxy stellar mass function to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function and AGN luminosity functions using different $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations and the observed Eddington-ratio distribution. By comparing our predictions against observed AGN luminosity functions at $z\\sim 5.5$ we find that observations can be reproduced either by highly-elevated $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations paired with low duty cycles, or moderate relations with higher duty cycles. Through the Soltan argument, we find that $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations that are modestly above the local relation for AGN produce consistency between multiple tracers of the SMBH demography at $z\\sim 5.5$, while more extreme normalisations would require a weakly-evolving luminosity function at $z> 5.5$. Continuity-equation modelling shows that initially high $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations predict a strong two-phase evolutionary scenario and very steep low-mass SMBH mass functions in tension with several current estimates, while more moderate relations generate local SMBH mass functions in better agreement with present determinations and near-constant scaling relations. Our results favour a scenario where SMBHs at $z \\sim 5$ on average lie modestly above local AGN scaling relations, with elevated but physically plausible duty cycles. Future wide-field clustering and demographic studies will help break the remaining degeneracies between SMBH scaling relations and AGN duty cycles at early cosmic times."}

Studies have explored the dynamical evolution of SMBH pairs under the influence of dynamical friction to calculate pairing times and predict the expected population of dual-AGNs at various redshifts. We formulate a three-dimensional dynamical model of SMBH pairs in the innermost kiloparsec of a post-merger galaxy to investigate the impact of orbital inclination with respect to the galactic disk on pairing times. The SMBH pairs are evolved in 81 different galaxy configurations initialized using a Gauss-Seidel Poisson solver. The dynamics are calculated for 12 distinct initial inclinations ranging from 0 to 75 degrees in each of the galaxies to gauge the impact of inclination on pairing time. Orbits characterized by initial inclinations greater than 20 degrees frequently require longer pairing times when compared to uninclined orbits. Pairing times for orbits with inclinations $\\gtrsim 45$ degrees often exceed 14 Gyr. Galaxies with higher mass SMBH pairs and faster rotating disks generally shorten pairing times relative to galaxies with less massive or slower rotating disks when the inclination is $\\lesssim 45$ degrees.

In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{ν_μ} \\sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons).

Understanding phenomena such as episodic ejections and outflow asymmetries can thus shed light on the mechanism of jet launching and its connection to both mass accretion and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We use new VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode observations of the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28 to map the jet structures within 6'' of the source at an effective angular resolution of 0.''12, provided by the combination of the AO correction and image deconvolution. The emission line profiles and flux ratios are investigated and diagnostic analysis of the optical forbidden emission lines (FELs) is used to estimate the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and shock velocities in both jet lobes within 200 au of the star. The mass outflow rates in each lobe are obtained using the derived total densities and FEL luminosities and compared with the mass accretion rate. We identify several new knots in both jet lobes which have been ejected in the previous 10 years on a timescale of 3-6 years, which is significantly more frequent than previously estimated. In both lobes we find comparable mass outflow rates close to the jet base. Th 28 has undergone a significant rise in mass accretion rate between 2014 and 2023, which may be linked to the most recently ejected knot pair detected in each side of the jet. The red-shifted jet mass outflow rate shows a similar increase of a factor 2, indicating that the ratio of mass outflow to accretion remains constant. A moderately lower mass outflow rate is found in the faster blue-shifted lobe, supporting the possibility that momentum ejection is conserved on each side of the jet. The frequent knot ejections indicate that this source is a good target for further monitoring to study the accretion-ejection connection."}

While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \\, σ$ to $2 \\, σ$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods."}

The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating simultaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement traditional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity > 6 GV. The timing of the prompt and delayed peaks coincided with the proton flux peaks observed by the GOES-18 satellite at energies > 150 MeV and 12-99 MeV, respectively. It is observed that the GLE amplitude has a strong dependence on geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and has a weak solar zenith angle dependence."}

This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $λ$ Boötis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($>$5 M$_\\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $λ$ Boötis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $λ$ Boötis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($>100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $λ$ Boötis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns."}

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models."}

Re-submitted to A&A after addressing initial referee comments, comments welcome", "summary": "XRISM has provided an unprecedented view of the emission and absorption lines in the X-ray. Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind."}

In this Letter, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the optical to the infrared for 1,328 candidates, incorporating GALEX ultraviolet photometry to assess the presence of hidden hot companions. We quantify ultraviolet excess by comparing observed near-ultraviolet fluxes with single-star SED predictions and further test whether excesses can be explained by non-degenerate stellar companions for sources exhibiting moderate excess. We additionally examine the Galactic kinematics of the sample to identify systems potentially affected by natal kicks during compact-object formation. By combining the ultraviolet and kinematic diagnostics, we identify 176 sources as the highest-priority candidates for follow-up observations, in which 19 are black hole candidates with previously provided masses $\\geq$ 3 $M_\\odot$."}

Our analysis shows that Ly$α$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models. Looking ahead, the upcoming generation of 30-meter class telescopes will be critical for enabling these measurements, offering a compelling opportunity to distinguish the nature of dark matter by mapping the structure of cosmic filaments."}

Accepted in ApJ", "summary": "The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\\sim0.1~M\\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\\sim10^{29}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS."}

NGC 4278, a local LLAGN, has recently been identified as a VHE source following detections by LHAASO. In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{ν_μ} \\sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons). Future multi-messenger observations are essential to unveil the details of the high-energy processes of NGC 4278."}
