Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u542b\u6709\u591a\u5b54\u5c18\u57c3\u7684\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c18\u57c3\u805a\u96c6\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u5b54\u5c18\u57c3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08SI\uff09\u514b\u670d\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u5b54\u5c18\u57c3\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c18\u57c3\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8003\u8651CO\u96ea\u7ebf\u65f6\uff0c\u76d8\u5185\u5927\u533a\u57df\u572810\u4e07\u5e74\u5185\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5426\u5219\u4ec5\u5728\u5185\u8fb9\u7f18\u621620\u4e07\u5e74\u540e\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5b54\u5c18\u57c3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\uff0cCO\u96ea\u7ebf\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In this paper we describe a method by which the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could detect such moons: broadband reflected-light lunar eclipses (e.g., the moon passing into the shadow of the planet). We find that an Earth-like moon orbiting a Jovian-size planet at 1au can outshine its host planet near 1 micron, producing frequent (days time-scale) lunar eclipses with depths of order 50%. We determine that single eclipse events out to $\\sim$12pc may be detectable for Earth-like moons around giant planets, down to $0.9R_\\oplus$. Detection of smaller moons, $\\sim$0.5$R_\\oplus$ (corresponding to about the size of Mars or Ganymede), may be possible, but would generally require multiple events for most systems. These several-hour events provide a clear pathway to detecting habitable moons with HWO, given sufficient stare-time on each system to detect lunar eclipses. The occurrence rate of habitable exomoons remains unconstrained, however, making the ultimate yield uncertain.

The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \\simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\\sim 30\\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars.

The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \\times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \\times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \\times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \\times 10^4 - 5 \\times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9W40\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\u4e2dHCN\u548cHCO$^+$ J = $3 - 2$\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RADEX\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u7801\u548cNAUTILUS\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76HCN\u548cHCO$^+$\u5728\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JCMT\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RADEX\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u5047\u8bbe\u6052\u5b9a\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u548cNAUTILUS\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8003\u8651H$_2$\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "HCN\u548cHCO$^+$\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a$0.4-7.0 \times 10^{-8}$\u548c$0.4-7.3 \times 10^{-9}$\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a$5 \times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$\uff1bUV\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5728\u9ad8A_V\u533a\u57df\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4eA_V\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HCN\u548cHCO$^+$\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u81ea\u81f4\u5bc6\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d7\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$.

Hogg", "Andrew Sayjdari", "Lily Zhao"], "title": "A constrained linear model for continuum normalization of stellar spectra", "comment": "AAS accepted", "summary": "Inferring stellar parameters and chemical abundances by forward modeling stellar spectra usually requires a spectral synthesis code, or an emulator constructed from a curated training set. In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars.

The effect of PDM on planet formation from a planetesimal disk", "comment": "17 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ (Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan)", "summary": "According to the canonical planet formation theory, planets form \"in-situ\" within a planetesimal disk via runaway and oligarchic growth. This theory, however, cannot naturally account for the formation timescale of ice giants or the existence of diverse exoplanetary systems. Planetary migration is a key to resolving these problems. One well-known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering of planetesimals. In our previous paper (Jinno et al. 2024, PASJ, 76, 1309), we investigated the migration of a single planet through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Here we perform the first high-resolution simulations of planet formation from a large-scale planetesimal disk, incorporating planet-gas disk interactions, planet-planetesimal interactions, gravitational interactions among all planetesimals, and physical collisions between planetesimals to investigate the role of PDM in the planet formation process. Our results show that protoplanets undergo dynamic inward/outward migrations during the runaway growth stage via PDM. Moreover, orbital repulsion combined with PDM tends to make two groups of protoplanets, outer ones going outward and inner ones going inward. Such dynamic migration significantly influences the early stages of planetary formation. These findings provide a viable pathway for the formation of Earth-like planets and ice giants' cores. Furthermore, they suggest that a standard protoplanetary disk model can account for the planetary migration necessary to explain diverse exoplanetary systems without the need for additional hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u661f\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb(PDM)\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u51b0\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u7c7b\u5730\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u51b0\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u884c\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u661f\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u76d8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u884c\u661f\u4e0e\u661f\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u661f\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76PDM\u5728\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u884c\u661f\u5728\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7PDM\u7ecf\u5386\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5916\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u6392\u65a5\u4e0ePDM\u7ed3\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u884c\u661f\u5206\u6210\u5185\u5916\u4e24\u7ec4\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u65e9\u671f\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u5373\u53ef\u8bf4\u660e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

We observe a significant decline in R3 values below Muv > -18, which we interpret as evidence of decreasing metallicities in fainter regimes. We explore four prescription models of the evolution of R3 with UV emission based on the new measurements and results from previous surveys. Applying these models to the GLIMPSE [O III]+Hb luminosity functions, we measure and extrapolate the ionising photon production rate $\\dot{N}_{ion}$ of galaxies down to very faint limits SFR(Ha) > 5e-3 Msun/yr. Our results support the dominant contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionisation, and are consistent with the recent discovery of ultra-faint metal-poor galaxies. Our measurements of the relative contribution of each luminosity bin show that galaxies with L(Ha)~1e41 to 1e42 erg/s dominate at 8<z<9, but the relative contributions become more uniform at $7<z<8$.

Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fbe\u7a46\u5c14-\u6ce2\u5229\u4e9a\u79d1\u592b\uff08DP\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u677e\u5f1b\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u81a8\u80c0\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u677e\u5f1b\u5bf9\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728DP\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7b2c\u4e94\u529b\u548c\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u4e2a\u5145\u6ee1\u65e0\u538b\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u666e\u904d\u8026\u5408\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u5766FLRW\u5b87\u5b99\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u70b9\u5c55\u5f00\u5171\u5f62\u8026\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6807\u91cf\u7269\u8d28\u533a\u57df\u7684\u665a\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u5b87\u5b99\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ea\u80fd\u6e10\u8fd1\u5730\u63a5\u8fd1\u8be5\u70b9\u3002\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e94\u529b\u548c\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u6291\u5236\u53d7DP\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u5c4f\u853d\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u8272\u9f99\u6216\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u60c5\u666f\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u5f31\u573a\u504f\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes.

The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\u03b2$) is a powerful diagnostic of stellar populations and one of the few feasible indicators of the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f$_{\\rm esc}$) for such faint galaxies at high-redshift. Leveraging ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam GLIMPSE imaging of strong lensing field Abell S1063, we estimate UV continuum slopes of 555 galaxies at z $>$ 6 with absolute magnitudes down to M$_{\\rm UV}$ $\\simeq -$12.5. We find a modest evolution of $\u03b2$ with redshift and a flattening in the $\u03b2$-M$_{\\rm UV}$ relation such that galaxies fainter than M$_{\\rm UV}$ $\\sim -$16.5 no longer exhibit the bluest UV slopes. The 138 ultra-faint galaxies with M$_{\\rm UV}$ $> -$16 are a diverse population encompassing dusty (30\\%), old (15\\%), and low-mass (50\\%) galaxies. We apply the empirical $\u03b2$-f$_{\\rm esc}$ relation from local Lyman continuum leakers, finding the mean f$_{\\rm esc}$ peaks at $\\sim 20\\%$ at M$_{\\rm UV}=-$16.5 and declines towards fainter galaxies, while remaining consistent with f$_{\\rm esc}$ = 14\\% within uncertainties, in agreement with recent radiative transfer simulations. Incorporating GLIMPSE constraints on the UV luminosity function, ionizing photon production efficiency, and escape fractions produces a reionization history consistent with independent observational constraints. Our results indicate galaxies with M$_{\\rm UV}$ between $-18$ and $-14$ supplied $\\sim 60\\%$ of the ionizing photons to cosmic reionization, while the lower f$_{\\rm esc}$ of fainter galaxies produces a natural cutoff in the ionizing photon production rate density.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7JWST/NIRCam\u5bf9\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u573aAbell S1063\u7684\u8d85\u6df1\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86z>6\u7684\u6781\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\uff08MUV>-16\uff09\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u659c\u7387\uff08\u03b2\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u03b2-MUV\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\uff0c\u6781\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u9003\u9038\u5206\u6570\uff08fesc\uff09\u7ea6\u4e3a14%-20%\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u7ea660%\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6781\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\uff08MUV>-16\uff09\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u5145\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2b\u5916\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u659c\u7387\uff08\u03b2\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u5206\u6570\uff08fesc\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRCam\u5bf9\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u573aAbell S1063\u7684\u8d85\u6df1\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86555\u9897z>6\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u03b2\u503c\uff0c\u5149\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3MUV\u2243-12.5\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730Lyman\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6cc4\u6f0f\u661f\u7684\u03b2-fesc\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684fesc\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u03b2-MUV\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\uff0c\u6781\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\u7684fesc\u5cf0\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a20%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u4e3a14%\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u7ea660%\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\uff08MUV\u5728-18\u81f3-14\u4e4b\u95f4\uff09\u662f\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5149\u5b50\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684fesc\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u66f4\u5fae\u5f31\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

High-resolution spectroscopy that leads to dynamical measurements of binary stars can directly improve these models. We have been using the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph to monitor binary stars with M dwarf components. Here, we measure the orbital and stellar parameters for three such systems: LSPM J0515+5911, NLTT 43564, and NLTT 45468. Each system has dozens of spectra obtained over a baseline of several years. None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions. LSPM J0515+5911 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with period of $126.948 \\pm 0.029$ days and derived minimum masses, $M_1\\sin^3i =0.058 \\pm 0.002$ $M_\\odot$ and $M_2\\sin^3i = 0.046 \\pm 0.001$ $M_\\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively.

Only long-term RV surveys with sub-meter per second precision instruments can explore the outer regions of Sun-like stars and look for Earth-like planets and super-Earths. We present the analysis of the K-type star HD 176986. It has a brightness of V=8.45 mag and a distance from the Sun of d = 27.88 pc. This star hosts a known planetary system of two super-Earths. We joined historical datasets with new data collected in an ongoing blind search program. We took advantage of recently developed tools for RV extraction and stellar activity filtering. The analysis of activity indicators permits us to determine the period of the magnetic cycle of the star alongside its rotation period. We performed a joint analysis of RVs and activity indicators through multidimensional GPs to better constrain the activity model in RVs and avoid overfitting. We detected a new planet orbiting the star and retrieved the two known planets.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\\,M_\\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \\lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6027S(Z, z)\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30BBH\u5408\u5e76\u738710-10^4\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u51c6\u786e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u6027S(Z, z)\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9BBH\u5408\u5e76\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u51c6\u786e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3BBH\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528IllustrisTNG\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u6027S(Z, z)\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408COMPAS\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9BBH\u5408\u5e76\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u9ad8\u4f30\u5408\u5e76\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u59828M\u2299\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5176\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u91d1\u5c5e\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9BBH\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u7ed3\u5408\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome", "summary": "Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\\star\\sim10^{5.6}\\ M_\\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\\star=10^{6.6}\\ M_\\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRCam\u548cNIRSpec\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08$z\\sim6$\uff09\u8d85\u6697\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u9700\u8981\u6781\u7aef\u7535\u79bb\u6e90\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f3a[OIII]\u7ebf\u8868\u660e\u8d28\u91cf-\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u6781\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff08$M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684\u4e24\u6761\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u8d85\u6697\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u661f\u7cfb\u7ec4\u88c5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u6697\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRCam\u548cNIRSpec\u5bf9\u900f\u955c\u573aAbell S1063\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u6df1\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u679016\u4e2a\u4eae\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e$M_{\\rm UV}=-17$ mag\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6837\u672c\u661f\u7cfb\u666e\u904d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u9700\u6781\u7aef\u7535\u79bb\u6e90\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u5f3a[OIII]\u7ebf\u8868\u660e\u8d28\u91cf-\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3$M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5728$z=5.5$\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff08$M_\\star=10^{6.6}\\ M_\\odot$\uff09\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5c18\u57c3\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5728\u5c18\u57c3\u4ea7\u751f\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bcc\u96c6\u548c\u91cd\u5b50\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u8d85\u6697\u661f\u7cfb\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bcc\u96c6\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u661f\u7cfb\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u591a\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6700\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We use two years of data in three observing bands centered near 95, 150, and 220 GHz from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope that cover a 1646 deg$^2$ region of the Southern sky. Using the measured power spectra, we present constraints on the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find that inferred SZ powers are dependent on the detailed modeling of the thermal SZ-CIB correlation, and to a lesser extent on the assumed angular dependence of the SZ spectra. We report constraints for simulation-based model templates as well as fits where the angular dependencies of the SZ and CIB power spectra are allowed to vary. In the latter case at $\\ell=3000$, we find thermal SZ power at 143 GHz of $D_{3000}^{\\rm tSZ} = 4.91\\pm0.37\\, \u03bc{\\rm K}^2$ and kinematic SZ power of $D_{3000}^{\\rm kSZ} =1.75\\pm0.86\\, \u03bc{\\rm K}^2$. We use the measured kinematic SZ power to estimate the duration of reionization, noting that the reionization inferences are sensitive to the model choices and assumed level of homogeneous kinematic SZ power from the late-time universe. We find a 95% limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 25% to 75% of $\u0394^{50} z_{\\rm re} <\\,3.8$ based on a semi-analytic model, or a limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 5% to 95% of $\u0394^{90} z_{\\rm re} <\\,6.1$ based on the AMBER simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6e29\u5ea6\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6781\u8303\u56f41700\u2264\u2113\u226411,000\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86SZ\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\u548cCIB\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6e29\u5ea6\u529f\u7387\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9SZ\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\u548cCIB\u7684\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SPT-3G\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5728\u5357\u6781\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4e0a\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4e24\u5e74\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8986\u76d61646 deg\u00b2\u7684\u5357\u5929\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d8\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u2113=3000\u5904\uff0c\u6d4b\u5f97143 GHz\u70edSZ\u529f\u7387\u4e3a4.91\u00b10.37 \u03bcK\u00b2\uff0c\u52a8SZ\u529f\u7387\u4e3a1.75\u00b10.86 \u03bcK\u00b2\uff1b\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a\u0394^{50}z_re<3.8\u6216\u0394^{90}z_re<6.1\u3002", "conclusion": "SZ\u529f\u7387\u548cCIB\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5747\u5300\u52a8SZ\u529f\u7387\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Published in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3Sgr A*\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eSgr A*\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u8000\u6591\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8de8\u6ce2\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u6ede\u540e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f2\u7ebf\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u771f\u5b9eSgr A*\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728Sgr A*\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The large sample clearly displays the Kraft break at $\\sim 6{,}500$\\,K, or mass of $\\sim1.3\\,M_{\\odot}$-while vbroad are small, on the order of $10$-$20$ km/s, for stars cooler than the Kraft break, they sharply rise above the break, reaching up $\\sim100$ km/s with temperature of $7{,}000$ K. To follow the stellar rotation as a function of age, we consider vbroad as a function of scaled age-stellar age divided by the relevant Terminal Age Main Sequence (MS), for four narrow mass bins. We find that stellar rotation deceleration is slow during the MS phase and fast afterwards for stars hotter than the break, whereas deceleration rate is relatively high and does not vary much for the cool stars. Our findings are consistent with the theory that stellar rotation slowing is due to magnetic breaking, emanating from magnetic fields that are anchored to the stellar convective envelopes. Therefore, deceleration is high in cool stars, but in hot stars only after they leave the MS and develop convective outer layers", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528Gaia DR3\u768410^5\u6761\u5bbd\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Kraft\u65ad\u70b9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u951a\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u51cf\u901f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1Kraft\u65ad\u70b9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u78c1\u573a\u951a\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u51cf\u901f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710^5\u6761Gaia DR3\u7684vbroad\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6309\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c06\u5e74\u9f84\u6309\u6052\u661f\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u5bff\u547d\uff08TAMS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kraft\u65ad\u70b9\uff08\u7ea66,500K\u62161.3M\u2609\uff09\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6052\u661f\u7684\u81ea\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0810-20 km/s\uff09\uff1b\u65ad\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5219\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff08\u53ef\u8fbe100 km/s\uff09\u3002\u51b7\u6052\u661f\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u9636\u6bb5\u51cf\u901f\u8f83\u5feb\uff0c\u800c\u70ed\u6052\u661f\u5728\u4e3b\u5e8f\u540e\u51cf\u901f\u52a0\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u6052\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u51cf\u901f\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u951a\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u7684\u78c1\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u51b7\u6052\u661f\u51cf\u901f\u5feb\uff0c\u800c\u70ed\u6052\u661f\u4ec5\u5728\u79bb\u5f00\u4e3b\u5e8f\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6d41\u5916\u5c42\u540e\u51cf\u901f\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

The two first authors contributed equally to this manuscript", "summary": "Understanding the climates of terrestrial exoplanets and the detectability of biosignatures is an inherently interdisciplinary challenge, requiring the integration of insights from Solar System exploration, exoplanet observations and climate science. Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures.

Spatially, a new extended $\u03b3$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\u03b1$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\u0393\\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\u03b3$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147.

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9a6c\u5934\u661f\u4e91UV\u7167\u5c04\u8fb9\u7f18\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86UV\u8f90\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u67d0\u4e9b\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1UV\u8f90\u5c04\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08COMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u533a\uff08PDRs\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6b64\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22UV\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408ALMA\u548cIRAM 30m\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9a6c\u5934\u661f\u4e91UV\u7167\u5c04\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u524dC$^{17}$O\u3001C$^{18}$O\u548cPdBI\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5256\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08\u5982H$_2$CO\u3001CH$_2$CO\u7b49\uff09\u5728UV\u7167\u5c04\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e30\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u6709\u5173\uff1b\u800cHC$_3$N\u548cCH$_3$OH\u4f8b\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u56e0\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u975e\u70ed\u89e3\u5438\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "UV\u8f90\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u76f8\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u5171\u540c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u67d0\u4e9bCOMs\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u51b7UV\u8f90\u7167\u73af\u5883\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002"}}

We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u52a8\u6001\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b87\u5b99\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5149\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff1a\u56e2\u5757\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6d1e\u3001\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb-\u7ea2\u79fb\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u8d85\u65b0\u661fIa\u53ca\u91cd\u5b50\u58f0\u6ce2\u632f\u8361\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5b87\u5b99\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u7531\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u867d\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

The online resources (see Appendix D) will be available to the public after the article is published", "summary": "This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei.

This work investigates whether metallic (M-type) asteroids exhibit systematically higher rotation rates than the broader asteroid population. Using recent Mahlke's taxonomy and a multi-method statistical approach that combines classical hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and resampling techniques, we consistently find evidence that metallic asteroids rotate, on average, faster. The results remain robust across different ways of controlling for asteroid size and sampling biases. While limitations remain due to sample size, heterogeneous data sources, and possible selection effects, the convergence of independent methods strengthens the conclusion that metallic composition is associated with higher rotation rates.

Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \\propto t^{-\u03bd}e^{-t/\u03c4_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\u03be$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2\u03b8_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\u03be< \u03be_c \\approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\u03be= 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\\sim 1\\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\u03bd\\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e42\u5f8b\u76f8\u5173\u6e4d\u6d41\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u57fa\u5c55\u5f00\u5fae\u6270\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ea7\u6570\u6536\u655b\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u7684Mittag-Leffler\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6e4d\u6d41\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u7b49\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcLaplace\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7269\u8d28\u57fa\uff08cos2\u03b8m\u22481\uff09\u5c55\u5f00\u5fae\u6270\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u03be\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5c55\u5f00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u7684Mittag-Leffler\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7ea7\u6570\u6536\u655b\u534a\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u03be<\u03bec\u22480.8\u65f6\u7ea7\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u51e0\u4f55\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u03be=0.16\uff08\u5178\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e0b\u4e09\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe1%\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50-\u6e4d\u6d41\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication by The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "We investigate longitude-velocity ($\\ell$-$v$) diagrams as a diagnostic tool to study the metallicity structure of the Milky Way (MW) disk. The present-day metallicity structure encodes the imprint of the Galaxy's formation, assembly, and secular evolution. Using oxygen abundances from HII regions across the MW disk, together with MW-mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological simulations, we show that $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams trace radial metallicity gradients and non-axisymmetric azimuthal metallicity variations. Because they do not rely on distance measurements, $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams complement face-on maps for studying metallicity structure. In the MW, we detect the radial metallicity gradient in $\\ell$-$v$ space, but current HII region oxygen abundance errors are too high to reveal azimuthal variations. In the FIRE-2 MW-mass galaxies, the radial gradient is evident in $\\ell$-$v$ diagrams regardless of observer location, but anomalous gas kinematics can mimic azimuthal metallicity variations. We term these \"anomalous motions\", which have an excess local standard of rest (LSR) velocity tail 3 times larger in the FIRE-2 simulations compared to the MW.

We test two scenarios for training: (1) on the data vectors and (2) on the full $\u03ba$-maps.

Simulations of sunquake excitation suggest co-excitation with wavefronts propagating in the corona and chromosphere, similar to Moreton-Ramsey waves, and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). To investigate observational evidence for the particle-driven mechanism in LCPFs, we compare populations of events associated with and without coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are known to generate similar EUV shock waves. We employ a visual inspection of flare events that generate LCPFs using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) coronagraph images to find that coronal waves associated with CMEs propagate noticeably faster. Then we examine GOES soft X-ray (SXR) data of standalone flare events (those that generate coronal waves without CMEs), focusing on soft X-ray (SXR) characteristics related to magnetic energy release rate. This reveals that such standalone or confined flares differ from sunquake flares: they are less impulsive and energetic than sunquake flares. However, they are more impulsive but less energetic than LCPF-associated flares with a CME. In particular, coronal waves accompanied by CMEs exhibit significantly higher volume emission measures, suggesting a different generation mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u5730\u9707\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0eCME\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f34\u968fCME\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800c\u5b64\u7acb\u8000\u6591\u7684SXR\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u5730\u9707\u8000\u6591\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u65e5\u5195\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f20\u64ad\u6ce2\uff08LCPFs\uff09\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0e\u548c\u4e0d\u4e0e\u65e5\u5195\u7269\u8d28\u629b\u5c04\uff08CMEs\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528AIA\u548cLASCO\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790LCPFs\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790GOES\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0e\u78c1\u80fd\u91ca\u653e\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684SXR\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4f34\u968fCME\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u5b64\u7acb\u8000\u6591\u7684SXR\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u5730\u9707\u8000\u6591\u5728\u51b2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u4f34\u968fCME\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u6ce2\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u53d1\u5c04\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f34\u968fCME\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4f34\u968fCME\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u6ce2\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u8000\u6591\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u5730\u9707\u8000\u6591\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Using the optical spectrometer Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we carry out a pilot study on high-resolution phase curve spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9 b. We spectrally and temporally resolve its dayside emission from post-transit to pre-eclipse (orbital phase phi = 0.1 - 0.45). The signal strength and width increase with orbital phases as the dayside rotates into view. The net Doppler shift varies progressively from -13.4 +/- 0.6 to -0.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, the extent of which exceeds its rotation velocity of 6.4 +/- 0.1 km/s, providing unambiguous evidence of atmospheric winds. We devise a retrieval framework to fit the full time-series spectra, accounting for the variation of line profiles due to the rotation and winds. We retrieve a supersonic day-to-night wind speed up to 11.7 +/- 0.6 km/s on the emerging dayside, representing the most extreme atmospheric winds in hot Jupiters to date. Comparison to 3D circulation models reveals a weak atmospheric drag, consistent with relatively efficient heat recirculation as also supported by space-based phase curve measurements.

Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\\star\\simeq10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\\mathrm{H2}<7\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$\u03b1$ and H$\u03b1$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cfz\u22733\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5f53\u524d\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cAGN\u55b7\u6d41\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5468\u56f4CGM\u6e4d\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ef4\u6301\u661f\u7cfb\u4f4e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5468\u56f4CGM\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eAGN\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ecChandra X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790MQN01\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4e00\u4f8b\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684CGM\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u90bb\u8fd1AGN\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u51b7\u6c14\u4f53\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u90bb\u8fd1AGN\u55b7\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aCGM\u6e4d\u6d41\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u5bcc\u6c14\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7ef4\u6301\u4f4e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u9759\u6b62\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30\u00b0, |b| < 20\u00b0) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities.

The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$\u03b1$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528ALMA\u7684CO(1-0)\u89c2\u6d4b\u548cVLT/MUSE\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86ULIRG\u661f\u7cfbIRAS20100-4156\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u7535\u79bb\u548c\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u53ca\u5c18\u57c3\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8868\u5f81ULIRG\u661f\u7cfbIRAS20100-4156\u4e2d\u591a\u76f8\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5916\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408CO(1-0)\u7ebf\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5e94\u6052\u661f\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u975e\u5f15\u529b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u76f8\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe8\u00d710\u2079 M\u2299\u7684\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u5360\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u768440%\u3002\u5916\u6d41\u5448\u53cc\u9525\u5f62\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6170 km/s\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387700 M\u2299/yr\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u768415%\u548c3%\u3002\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a3.5\u00d710\u2077 M\u2299\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u76f8\u5916\u6d41\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u4e1c\u5357\u6838\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5916\u6d41\u52a0\u901f\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$\u03b1$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\u03c9_{\\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \\lesssim 0.35 h\\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.30 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.25 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\u03b1$ samples.

To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86G33.641$-$0.228\u533a\u57df6.7 GHz\u7532\u9187\u8109\u6cfd\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u5f0f\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u901a\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u5c04\u7535\u7206\u53d1\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57dfG33.641$-$0.228\u4e2d\u76846.7 GHz\u7532\u9187\u8109\u6cfd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7206\u53d1\u5f0f\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u6b21\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u5706\u504f\u632f\u76d1\u6d4b\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5de6\u53f3\u65cb\u5706\u504f\u632f\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u901a\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u632f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5728\u7206\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\u4ee50.3\u5929\u7684\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5728\u7206\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u964d\u81f3\u96f6\u3002\u504f\u632f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e5f\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e00\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u89c6\u7ebf\u540e\u65b9\u7684\u8109\u6cfd\u4e91\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u592a\u9633\u5c04\u7535\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5706\u504f\u632f\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\u88ab\u8109\u6cfd\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u632f\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f31\u5916\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8Blandford-Znajek\u5206\u88c2\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u55b7\u6d41\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9644\u8fd1\u5916\u90e8\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u55b7\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982Sgr A*\u7f3a\u5931\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u55b7\u6d41\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f31\u5916\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684Blandford-Znajek\u5206\u88c2\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u4e0a\u534a\u7403\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u55b7\u6d41\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u53d6\u6d88\uff1b\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u53d7\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u975e\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u9003\u9038\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u800c\u53cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u55b7\u6d41\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u62b5\u6d88\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u5929\u4f53\uff08\u5982Sgr A*\uff09\u7f3a\u5931\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u55b7\u6d41\u7184\u706d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopy, alongside DR3 Gaia astrometry, and bolometric fluxes, we derive updated fundamental parameters for both components. In particular, we uncover a significant chemical difference: the primary is metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ \\simeq - 0.57$), while the secondary shows solar-like metallicity ([Fe/H]$=0.00$). This suggests that the system originated in a mildly metal-poor environment, consistent with the Galactic thick disk population, and that the secondary's surface composition has been altered by a recent accretion event. Using multi-sector TESS photometry, we detected solar-like oscillations in both components, deriving global asteroseismic parameters $\u0394\u03bd= 43.32 \\pm 3.91 \u03bc$Hz, $\u03bd_{\\rm max} = 708.74^{+3.23}_{-3.74} \u03bc$Hz for HD81809 A, and $\u0394\u03bd= 97.75 \\pm 4.49~\u03bc$Hz, $\u03bd_{\\rm max} = 2098.07^{+3.07}_{-2.83} \u03bc$Hz for HD81809 B.

(2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t~1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa ~200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t~= 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach ~ 19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by ~ 2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of ~ 60 deg for t <=1 days.

Surface helium abundances in Galactic O-type stars: indications for identifying binary interaction products", "comment": "Submitted to A&A on 2026, January 18th. Comments welcome", "summary": "The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction -- particularly mass-transfer episodes -- may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe>0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9318\u9897\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfbO\u578b\u661f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u6c26\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b022%\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u6c26\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aO\u578b\u6052\u661f\u8868\u9762\u6c26\u4e30\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u65cb\u8f6c\u6df7\u5408\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528IACOB-BROAD\u548cFASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9318\u9897\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfbO\u578b\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5747\u8d28\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6c26\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u3001\u9003\u9038\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u9000\u5316\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b078%\u7684\u6052\u661f\u6c26\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u4e30\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08YHe=0.098\u00b10.002\uff09\uff0c22%\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u6c26\u5bcc\u96c6\uff08YHe>0.13\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bcc\u96c6\u6052\u661f\u591a\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662fO\u578b\u661f\u6c26\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u9897O\u578b\u661f\u5149\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u65f6\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "There is a fundamental lack of understanding as to why quasars that are otherwise very similar can have such a wide range of radio jet powers, and the large-scale environment is thought to play an important role. We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\\ h^{-1}M_\\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8622\u4e07\u4e2a\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u55b7\u6d41\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u5bcc\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528eBOSS\u548cLoTSS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u55b7\u6d41\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u805a\u7c7b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u55b7\u6d41\u8d21\u732e\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u805a\u7c7b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u591a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\uff0810^{13-14} h^{-1}M_\\\\\\\\odot\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u89e6\u53d1\u65e0\u6700\u5c0f\u6655\u6216\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u55b7\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u3002"}}

We use proper motions combined with backward orbit integration in a semi-analytic potential to constrain plausible interaction scenarios for Pisces and And XVI. Both dwarfs are currently M31 satellites, defined as being inside its virial radius. However, our results show that, in our fiducial mass models, 42% (And XVI) and 60% (Pisces) of dwarf orbits support that they were previously satellites of M33 (i.e., once inside its virial radius). Both dwarfs had fly-by encounters with M33 at relative velocities greater than M33's escape speed within the past 1-2 Gyr. In over 70% of orbits, Pisces and And XVI also had a close approach with each other post-M33 interaction and share an orbital plane, suggesting possible past group accretion. We explore a range of mass combinations for M31 and M33, finding that this primarily regulates the likelihood that the dwarfs were satellites of M33 in the past, while upholding conclusions of recent flybys about M33. These close interactions provide new evidence for past satellite exchange and/or group infall scenarios between M31 and M33.

However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's \"impossibly early\" galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of $3-4$. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9065\u8fdc\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u591a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08IMF\uff09\u66f4\u201c\u5e95\u90e8\u91cd\u201d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9065\u8fdc\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56IMF\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5916IMF\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528JWST-IMFERNO\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf99\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u7ea60.7\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8d85\u6df1\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LEGA-C\u7684\u84dd\u5149\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176IMF\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9065\u8fdc\u661f\u7cfb\u7684IMF\u6bd4\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u66f4\u201c\u5e95\u90e8\u91cd\u201d\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u66f4\u591a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\uff08JWST\u65e9\u671f\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u540e\u4ee3\uff09\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u589e\u52a0\u4e863-4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "IMF\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4fee\u6b63\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u9065\u8fdc\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u66f4\u591a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}
