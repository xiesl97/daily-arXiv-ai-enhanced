Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z < 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z > 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z > 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe."}

In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived \"free phase\" where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a \"trapped phase\", where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $γ_{\\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $σ$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\\rm free}/dγ\\propto γ^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $γ_{\\rm cool}$ (in the range $γ_{\\rm cool}<γ<γ_{\\rm rad}$) is $dN/dγ\\propto γ^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/dγ\\propto γ^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles."}

For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\\sim$3.5).

VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions", "comment": "This paper has been accepted by ApJ", "summary": "Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (>8 M$_{\\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems."}

We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (>~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models."}

Because of its orbit and its spectral properties, it was proposed that Kamo`oalewa originated from the Moon as impact ejecta, possibly from the Giordano Bruno crater. We aim at estimating the relative contribution of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originating from the general near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population which originated in the main asteroid belt, and compare it with the relative contribution of Giordano Bruno ejecta. We first estimate the average fraction of quasi-satellite orbits at any given time. By using recently developed NEA population models, we extract the expected number of Earth co-orbitals of the same size of Kamo`oalewa, and then get an estimate of the average number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects using the fraction computed before. Similarly, we obtain an estimate for the number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects that may originate as ejecta from the Giordano Bruno impact. We also performed survey simulations to estimate their efficiency in the detection of Kamo`oalewa-like objects. We found that the main belt accounts for 1.23 \\pm 0.13 Kamo`oalewa-like objects on average. The expected number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originated as Giordano Bruno ejecta is 0.042, which is more than order of magnitude smaller. We found a discovery efficiency of Earth quasi-satellites between 95% and 70% for absolute magnitude between 22 and 25 for the Pan-STARRS survey, and population models show that this is in agreement with the known population. The Vera Rubin Observatory should reach an efficiency of 92% down to absolute magnitude 25. These estimates show that population models of NEAs are capable to account for Kamo`oalewa-like objects, thus supporting the hypothesis that that Kamo'oalewa originated from the main belt. This will be further investigated by the in-situ exploration of the Tianwen-2 mission."}

This is a preliminary version and comments welcome!", "summary": "The superorbital modulations (SMs) observed in wind-fed X-ray binaries remain a puzzling phenomenon in astrophysics. To investigate this behavior observationally, we analyzed the long-term hard X-ray light curve from the Swift/BAT 157-Month Hard X-ray Survey in X-ray binary GX 301-2. Using three timing analysis methods--the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet Ztransform, and Gaussian processes--we identify a rare dual-SM behavior in this source: the 115-day modulation exceeds the 5$σ$ global significance level, whereas the 65-day signal only marginally reaches the 4$σ$ level. Because the 115-day period is more consistent with the previously reported linear relation between orbital and superorbital periods, we interpret 115 days as the actual superorbital period, while the weaker and less stable 65-day period is its beat modulation with the orbital period.By assessing the applicability of different physical scenarios to our results, we suggest that this dual-SM behavior is most plausibly associated with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the stellar wind. This framework can also account for the observed linear orbital-superorbital relation, despite the unclear physical mechanism that sets the apparent ratio between the CIR and orbital periods across sources. Further long-term monitoring of this system, together with continued theoretical development of the CIR scenario, will be essential for clarifying the origin of wind-fed SMs."}

The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a \"universal\" functional form.\n  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $β$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.\n  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\\sim13,000\\,\\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.\n  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.\n  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated."}

In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$α$, H$β$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample."}

Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $3~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites."}

Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models."}

This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution."}

Referee received Nov 19 2025, accepted Jan 13 2026", "summary": "Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 10$. Among them is the UHZ1 system at $z=10.1$, containing $\\sim 10^8M_\\odot$ in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of $\\sim 10^{7-8}M_\\odot$. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots."}

Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively."}

Proto-binary and multiple systems with close separations are particularly valuable targets for investigating chemical inheritance and reaction, as their members are expected to form from similar material in their parental cloud. We present ALMA observations of the hierarchical proto-triple system HOPS-288, focusing on the physical structure, kinematics, and COM compositions. The system is treated as a proto-binary system consisting of HOPS-288-A and HOPS-288-B due to the limited spatial resolutions, with a separation of 200~au. Three COM-rich features are revealed: two hot corinos associated with the two members, rich in a variety of COMs, and an intervening component between the two members traced by CH$_3$OH and tentatively by CH$_3$CHO. The hot corino in HOPS-288-A exhibits rotational features and might trace a disk. The hot corino in HOPS-288-B is also possibly exhibiting rotational motion. The intervening component could possibly trace a shocked region in the circumbinary disk or a bridge between the two members. The column densities of COMs, including $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO, are broadly similar between the two sources, possibly suggesting the complex organic similarities among proto-binary/multiple systems. Given the complexity of the studied physical structures, further detailed investigations will be essential to confirm this result."}

The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background."}

For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes."}

In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(φ) = Λ_{c}^{4+2/3} φ^{-2/3}$. Unlike $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $Λ_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \\simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \\pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $Λ_{c} = 43.93 \\pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \\pm 0.007) \\times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets.

The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers."}

We present a comprehensive age analysis using the largest sample of candidate UMa members to date. Using Gaia DR3, we identify 1172 stars within 100 pc of the Sun with 3D kinematic motions consistent with group membership. We determine the age of UMa's dominant population using three independent methods: lithium equivalent widths $(393.6^{+85.1}_{-80.9}\\,\\mathrm{Myr})$, gyrochronology $(428 \\pm 93\\,\\mathrm{Myr})$, and photometric variability indicators $(449^{+114}_{-79}\\,\\mathrm{Myr})$. The three methods converge on a consistent age of $418^{+32}_{-34}\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. While our kinematic selection includes field stars that share UMa's space motion but are not coeval members, the convergent age determinations clearly identify a dominant population that formed together approximately 400 Myr ago. These stars are important benchmarks for studies of stellar rotation, magnetic activity evolution, and lithium depletion. The presence of systems such as HD~63433, a young multiplanet host within the group, further illustrates the value of UMa as a laboratory for early planetary system evolution. Our expanded catalog of kinematic candidates lays the groundwork for spectroscopic membership confirmation, refined mapping of the group's structure and chemistry, and future investigations of both stellar and planetary evolution at this key epoch."}

Sharp", "Susmita Garai"], "title": "Depletion of moderately volatile elements by pebble accretion in Earth-like planets", "comment": null, "summary": "Protoplanets growing by pebble accretion capture massive hydrogen-helium atmospheres from the surrounding nebula. Pebbles settling through such atmospheres continuously release gravitational potential energy, heating both the atmosphere and the pebbles. Under these conditions, atmosphere temperatures above large protoplanets are sufficiently high to melt silicate pebbles, support long-lived magma oceans, and drive evaporation of volatile species. Because these atmospheres are open to the nebula, some amount of volatile loss is inevitable. Here we analyze the depletion of moderately volatile elements from terrestrial protoplanets undergoing pebble accretion. We consider chondrule-size silicate pebbles enriched in Si, Na, K, and Zn relative to Earth, settling through a hydrogen-helium-rich atmosphere containing these same volatiles. We show that volatile depletion depends critically on protoplanet mass, the timescale of atmosphere exhaust, and the pebble composition. The protoplanetary mass effect is especially strong. For exhaust timescales of a few centuries, we find that substantial depletion of Zn begins around 0.4 Earth mass, and for Na and K around 0.6 Earth mass, with negligible depletion of these elements at smaller masses. Using a pebble composition that matches Earth's major element abundances, broad agreement with Earth's depletion trend for moderately volatile elements is found by merging a large (approximately 0.7 Earth mass) volatile-depleted target protoplanet with one or more smaller, less-depleted impactors."}

Beaming is a commonly invoked mechanism to explain their extreme brightness, and the dependence of the beaming factor on accretion rate is a critical parameter. In this work, we investigate how different beaming prescriptions affect the predicted properties of ULX populations. Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s. These results underscore the significant role of the beaming law in shaping ULX statistical distributions and assessing neutron star contributions to the population."}

We compare the impact of changing between NLA, TATT, and TATT+VS on the theoretical computation of the 3PCF using the best fit parameters and tomographic redshift distributions from Dark Energy Survey Year 3. We find that the TATT model significantly impacts the skewed triangle configurations of the 3PCF. Additionally, including the higher-order effects from TATT can introduce opposite effects on the two-point function and on the mass aperture skewness, damping the signal of the former while boosting the signal of the latter. We argue that a joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis with the TATT model can help break the degeneracy between its model parameters and provide more robust constraints on both cosmology and intrinsic alignment amplitude parameters. We show that typical values of order unity for the intrinsic alignment parameters introduce differences of around $10\\%$ between NLA and TATT predictions."}

At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe."}

In this paper, we explain the new inversion tool IRIS$^{2+}$ based on the IRIS$^{2+}$ database, which is based on 135,472 synthetic representative profiles (RP), each of them consisting of 6 chromospheric lines and 6 photospheric lines, their corresponding representative model atmospheres (RMA), and the integrated radiative losses (IRL) associated with these atmospheres. A nearest neighbor (k-nn) model algorithm is trained with the synthetic representative profiles to predict the closest RP in the database to the one observed, at which point IRIS$^{2+}$ assigns the RMA and the IRL to the location of that observed profile. We have compared the results obtained by IRIS$^{2+}$ with results obtained from the state-of-the-art inversion code STiC, which is also used to build the IRIS$^{2+}$ database. We find that the thermodynamics and the IRL obtained with both methods are comparable in most cases. Therefore, IRIS$^{2+}$ is a fast and reliable inversion tool that provides approximate values of the thermodynamic state and the radiative losses in the lower solar atmosphere for a large variety of solar scenes observed with IRIS."}

In this paper, we applied PRIISM imaging to ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data of the circumstellar disk around the Class I protostar CrA IRS 2, located in the Corona Australis molecular cloud, which is associated with an extended gas ring attributed to magnetic flux advection driven by interchange instability. The dust continuum image with 1.5 times higher spatial resolution than conventional imaging revealed, for the first time, the early-phase circumstellar disk with both inner central hole and outer ring-gap structures, making CrA IRS 2 the youngest system exhibiting such features based on the bolometric temperature of $T_{\\rm bol}$=235 K. To examine planet-disk interaction as one possible origin of the outer ring-gap structure, we found the measured depth and width to be consistent with planet-disk interaction models, suggesting the existence of a giant planet with a mass of 0.1-1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$. The additional mechanism required for rapid planet formation could be the magnetic flux dissipation driven by the interchange instability, which suppresses MRI-driven turbulence and extends the dead zone, allowing efficient dust growth and the early formation of planets. This system thus provides new insight into how substructures and planet formation can emerge during the early, accreting phase of disk evolution."}

Wide-field optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) play a crucial role in follow-up, but efficient scheduling is essential. In this work, we present LUMOS, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach that selects fields via a maximum coverage problem and schedules observations to maximize cumulative probability while respecting observability constraints. Using 1199 GW events from O4, we compare the LUMOS scheduler with gwemopt, showing an 84.7 percent higher mean cumulative probability and better performance in nearly all cases. While designed for ZTF, LUMOS's framework parallels the M4OPT toolkit for space missions, highlighting the broader applicability of MILP-based scheduling to both ground- and space-based follow-up."}

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models."}

By construction,the code can also be used to select objects that contaminate the high-z quasar population, i.e. brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \\geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \\leq z \\leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \\leq H_E \\leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \\lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys."}

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and Hα gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded."}

The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This \"quasi-snapshot\" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date."}

With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \\pm 0.47 M_{\\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \\pm 0.06 R_{\\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \\pm 1.3 M_{\\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches."}

For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude."}

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."}

We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, at both global and spatial scales, using the THEMIS dust model within the HerBIE code, applied to data from 3.4 $μ$m to 6 cm. We decompose emission into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components, and examine correlations with gas surface density and star formation activity.

We find $\\sim$10% radio emission at 2 mm, peaking at 18% in the southern bar-end, which hosts the highest star formation activity. However, an isolated star-forming region beyond this bar-end is the most efficient, as indicated by its elevated dust production efficiency and effective yield, predicted by our simplistic dust evolution model. The 160 $μ$m emission shows the strongest correlation with molecular gas, while 1.15 mm better traces the dust mass surface density.

Previous work has been able to study small EUV and SXR brightenings outside of active regions (i.e. the quiet Sun), but with HXRs this has mostly focused on active region transients/microflares due to the sensitivity of available telescopes. In this paper we present observations of the quiet Sun with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), an X-ray imaging spectrometer with much greater sensitivity than previous instruments, allowing the observation of faint events. During the recent solar minimum, NuSTAR captured seven quiet Sun flares/impulsive brightenings, three on 21 February 2020, and four on 12-13 September 2020. From fitting their NuSTAR HXR spectra we find temperatures of 3.1-4.0 MK and emission measures between (0.75-17.0) $\\times 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, which gives thermal energies between (2.5-8.9) $\\times 10^{26}$ erg. Only one event, a mini-filament eruption, showed evidence of slightly higher temperatures emission, confirmed through Differential Emission Measure analysis. None of the events showed evidence of non-thermal emission in their NuSTAR spectra, and we placed upper limits to the accelerated electron population. The thermal parameters for these quiet Sun events seem to scale differently to previously studied active region flares, suggesting a different energy release process might be dominating. However, this conclusion is affected by the different sensitivity and biases introduced by the various instruments and analysis approaches used."}

These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes."}

We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\\rm kHz}/M_\\odot$.

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints."}

In particular, we study the relations between star-formation (SF) and molecular gas surface density as a function of the interaction stage using two complementary approaches: beam-sized (unresolved, line-of-sight) regions and physically identified molecular gas clumps. To map the distribution of molecular gas we use ALMA CO(2-1) observations, while SF is traced using HST Pa-alpha or Pa-beta images. We derive spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations for each galaxy. When using beam-sized regions, we find that 67% of galaxies follow a single relation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2. However, in the remaining galaxies, the relation splits into two branches, indicating the presence of a duality in this relation. In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF. As the merger progresses, however, the amount of gas in the central kpc of the galaxy undergoing the merger increases, along with the SFR, and the slope of the KS relation becomes steeper, indicating an increase in SF efficiency of the gas clumps. Clumps in late-stage mergers are predominantly located at small distances from the nucleus, confirming that most of the activity is concentrated in the central regions. Finally, the relation between the SF efficiency and the boundedness parameter evolves from being roughly flat in the early stages of the merger to becoming positive in the final phases, indicating that clump self-gravity only starts to regulate the SF process between the early- and mid-merger stages."}

These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to < 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields."}

We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc < 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes."}

If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($Ω_{\\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ better than ($1\\%$, $1\\%$) in the $Λ$CDM model, ($1.5\\%$, $2\\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\\%$, $3.5\\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ to better than ($1\\%$, $2\\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons."}

As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\\times10^7~M_\\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\\sim1000~M_\\odot$) within $\\sim10~\\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence.

Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution."}

In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations.

Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2σ$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $Λ$CDM."}

However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE, we classify 35.7$\\pm$13.2\\% (57.1$\\pm$17.9\\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\\pm$14.0\\% (39.3$\\pm$14.0\\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\\pm$10.6\\% (3.6$\\pm$3.6\\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($α_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($τ_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $τ_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\\% of GVs exhibit $τ_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation."}

Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $ε' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$.

We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (>~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models."}

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models."}

This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ for the rate of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $ζ$ is the CR ionization rate of $\\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude. Hence, we strongly recommend the adoption of our new estimate $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ in all chemical models that include this process. Our newly derived value corresponds to $\\rm H_2$ being purely in the para form ($J^{\\prime\\prime} = 0$). However, in the interiors of molecular clouds the $\\rm H_2$ ortho-to-para ratio is low and using the rate for para-$\\rm H_2$ is an adequate approximation."}

JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z < 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z > 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z > 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe."}

The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background."}

Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models."}

Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively."}

Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $3~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites."}

The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This \"quasi-snapshot\" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all.

In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\\times10^7~M_\\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium.

The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a \"universal\" functional form.\n  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $β$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.\n  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\\sim13,000\\,\\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.\n  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.\n  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated."}

We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s.

Proto-binary and multiple systems with close separations are particularly valuable targets for investigating chemical inheritance and reaction, as their members are expected to form from similar material in their parental cloud. We present ALMA observations of the hierarchical proto-triple system HOPS-288, focusing on the physical structure, kinematics, and COM compositions. The system is treated as a proto-binary system consisting of HOPS-288-A and HOPS-288-B due to the limited spatial resolutions, with a separation of 200~au. Three COM-rich features are revealed: two hot corinos associated with the two members, rich in a variety of COMs, and an intervening component between the two members traced by CH$_3$OH and tentatively by CH$_3$CHO. The hot corino in HOPS-288-A exhibits rotational features and might trace a disk. The hot corino in HOPS-288-B is also possibly exhibiting rotational motion. The intervening component could possibly trace a shocked region in the circumbinary disk or a bridge between the two members. The column densities of COMs, including $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO, are broadly similar between the two sources, possibly suggesting the complex organic similarities among proto-binary/multiple systems. Given the complexity of the studied physical structures, further detailed investigations will be essential to confirm this result."}

Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $ε' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations. Calibrated photometric data yield an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 3.845 \\pm 0.006$, a phase-curve slope of $β= 0.1301 \\pm 0.0078$ mag deg$^{-1}$, and a visible geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.106^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, with colours consistent with moderately red TNO surfaces. No atmosphere or circum-object material is detected down to our sensitivity limits. The best-sampled event also allows a precise measurement of the angular diameter of the occulted star Gaia DR3 4056440205544338944, $θ_\\star = 0.670 \\pm 0.010$ mas."}

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."}

Nasser 1 shares consistent physical parameters (age, distance, kinematics, and reddening) with Czernik 38, suggesting they constitute a young primordial binary system in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Both clusters display elongations indicative of differential rotation tides; Nasser 1 is additionally perturbed by the spiral arm's gravitational field. Gaussian mass function analysis suggests the two were formerly a single cluster, violently torn apart by differential rotation."}

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints."}

These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to < 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields."}

This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $τ=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2σ$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $Λ$CDM."}
