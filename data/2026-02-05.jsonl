We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving~Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \\lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\\rm re} = 6.8\\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\\%$ neutral still at $z_{\\rm re} < 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$σ$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations."}

Comments welcome, ideally before submission to Discover Space by 12th February 2026", "summary": "The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $Λ$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α_{\\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \\gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions."}

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of this effect for the Fe I 6569 Å line using both observational data from the CHASE mission and numerical simulations from the Bifrost code. We employ two independent methods to derive the limb shift curve: a spectral-averaging method (Method 1) and a velocity-averaging method (Method 2). By comparing synthetic and observed data, we determine the convective blueshift, which is not accounted for in the CHASE observations. The simulations reproduce the observed trends for both methods at the instrument's spatial resolution of 1.2 arcsec. However, at resolutions below 1 arcsec, Method 2 produces limb-shift curves that depart significantly from both Method 1 results and traditional limb-shift profiles, whereas Method 1 remains in agreement with classical behavior. Further analysis finds that the results from Method 1 comprise two distinct components: a contrast contribution caused by the correlation between velocity and line depth, and a Dopplergram contribution caused by density inhomogeneities and corrugation effects."}

Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $β$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber."}

A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$.

Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $η(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations.

BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\\texttt{McFACTS}\\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \\texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}\\gtrsim40M_\\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions."}

The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work."}

Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $β=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution."}

The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects."}

While individual FD events have been extensively studied, systematic investigations of how GCR inter-station correlation variations relate to geomagnetic storm (GS) intensity have not been established. Here we analyze the relationship between GCR characteristics (from a global NM network) and GSs, aiming to understand the physical mechanisms of heliospheric disturbances and to develop complementary predictive capabilities beyond existing L1 solar wind monitoring. By applying a newly introduced anisotropy characteristic method alongside correlation analysis to 25 years of hourly NM data (1995-2020, seven stations), we demonstrate significant correlations between GCR parameters and geomagnetic activity. Inter-station relative differences and anisotropy enhancements show distinct precursor signatures depending on storm intensity, with extreme events displaying detectable signals 48-96 hours in advance. Based on these intensity-dependent response patterns, we propose a \"two-stage multi-level\" early warning framework: mid-term identification (48-96 hr) triggered by sustained anisotropy increases, followed by short-term grading (0-48 hr) based on inter-station relative difference variations and high-latitude flux changes. Validated on the extreme November 2003 and severe August 2018 geomagnetic storms, our approach successfully identifies precursor signals, providing a potential means to extend GS prediction windows."}

The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M > 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M < 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations."}

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression.

In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium."}

Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound. This highlights how utmost caution must be applied when studying wide binaries as isolated systems."}

Our DFT calculations revealed that both chlorine and fluorine can react barrierlessly with ethanol to abstract a hydrogen atom. We further found that, following this initial step, the resulting ethanol radicals can undergo further reactions with atomic hydrogen, with some routes leading to acetaldehyde. Incorporation of these novel reactions in astrochemical models of hot cores suggest that they are indeed efficient under those conditions, and can lead to modest increases in the abundance of CH3CHO during model times where gas-phase ethanol is abundant. Of the ethanol radicals included in our chemical network, we found CH3CHOH to have the highest abundances in our simulations comparable to that of ethanol at some model times. Overall, this work reveals a novel gas-phase ``top-down'' link from alcohols to aldehydes that compliments the better studied ``bottom-up'' routes involving grain-surface H-addition reactions yielding alcohols from aldehydes. Moreover, results from our astrochemical models suggest that the ethanol radical CH3CHOH may be detectable in the interstellar medium."}

Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds.

It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage."}

Using a semianalytic model, we account for direct collisions between BHs and stars and GW capture between BHs. We explore the effect of the initial BH mass and spin distributions on their final properties and the production of GW sources.

The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $Λ$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $Λ$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly."}

Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound. This highlights how utmost caution must be applied when studying wide binaries as isolated systems."}

To isolate non-circular effects, we remove the near--far ambiguity by selecting, for each gas element, the KD branch closest to its true distance. We find that the KD method reproduces the gas distribution reasonably well outside the bar-dominated region ($R \\gtrsim 5$~kpc), but fails systematically in the bar region ($R \\sim 0.5$--3~kpc). There the KD-reconstructed face-on map exhibits anisotropic, quadrant-dependent artifacts, including arc-like overdensities and LOS-elongated low-density cavities.

Comments welcome, ideally before submission to Discover Space by 12th February 2026", "summary": "The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $Λ$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α_{\\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \\gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions."}

The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."}

High-redshift galaxies are mostly point-like objects on ground-based images, but they often exhibit multiple components in higher spatial resolution images.

The fraction of the `real components' decreases rapidly with the projected distance to the LAE centers from $\\sim80\\%$ at $0\\farcs2-0\\farcs4$ to $\\sim30\\%$ at $0\\farcs8-1\\farcs0$. Our SED modeling results suggest that the majority of the LAEs are young, low-mass, low extinction starburst galaxies (partly due to a selection effect), and their `real components' have stronger star-forming activities than main-sequence galaxies. We investigate the potential impact of the high foreground contamination rate on previous studies based on ground-based images that often use a 2$\\arcsec$ aperture for photometry, and find that some of key parameters such as stellar mass would have been largely affected."}

Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $β=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$.

We develop a self-similar model and carry out a parameter study that examines disk stability as a function of the key drivers of early evolution, notably the infall rate from the envelope and the strength of the gravitational torques. The mass infall rate onto the disk is estimated to be that from the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere.

The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."}

It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($δ_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_φ$). Most $δ_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_φ=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M<11$). For high-mass halos (log$M>$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_φ= 2 δ_{\\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1>1$, but the $b_φ(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\\vert b_1\\lvert<1$.

The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work."}

This trend weakens at $z\\gtrsim2$, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times.

Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments."}

We validate photometric redshifts against $\\sim\\!185,\\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\\times10^{-2}$, $σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \\simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys."}

Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $β=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution."}

Velocity dispersions, $σ$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $ΔH/H_0 \\propto Δσ^2/σ^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $Δσ^2/σ^2$ < 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $Δσ^2/σ^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 3-8%.

It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M_{r} = -18.48 \\pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\\sim0.37\\,M_{\\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\\sim0.21\\,M_{\\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition.

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators."}

The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."}

It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage."}

Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound.

The spatial and kinematic stratification between the hot atomic and molecular components and the colder molecular gas is consistent with predictions from MHD disk wind models, although envelope material entrained by a wide-angle wind or jet may also contribute.

In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $β$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber."}
