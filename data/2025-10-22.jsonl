This work\ninvestigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter\nsubhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations\ndepends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the\ninner power-law slope, $\\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo\ndetectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on\n$\\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\\beta \\sim 2.2$ can be\ndetected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\\beta \\sim 1$. Importantly, we\nfind that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally\naffected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model.\nThis is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or\nshallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations\nare added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the\nunderlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of\nsubhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is\nimportant for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as\nSelf-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with\ndiverse inner density profiles."}

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas\nfraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we\nnote that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has\nnot been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}

Among 393\nbinary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify\n19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their\nmetallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population,\nmaking a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their\nformation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be\nresolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the\nprotoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that\nfacilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully\npredict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties.\nMoreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be\nevolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting\nthe model and pointing to these being second-generation planets.

Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various\nphysical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on\nthe effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline\nmixing on the atomic diffusion timescales.

Cloud radiative effect,\nwhich triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal\nvariability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed\nvariability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave\nactivity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes. Our results highlight that\nthe role of clouds as a driver of atmospheric dynamics and climate, well known\nfor giant exoplanets, extends to all sub-stellar bodies."}

The spectra reveal three distinct\nlayers of photoionized gas flowing outward from the central black hole: a\nlow-ionization phase (LIP), a higher-ionization phase (HIP), and a\nhigh-velocity and high ionization phase (HVIP). Each absorber leaves\ncharacteristic imprints on the soft X-ray spectrum. While the LIP and HVIP are\nfully consistent with being in ionization equilibrium with the central\nradiation field over the course of the $\\sim$250 ks spanned by the two\nobservations, the HIP shows a significant change in ionization ($3.8\\sigma$),\nsuggesting non-equilibrium. By modeling the two spectra with our time-dependent\nphotoionization code (TEPID), we constrain the density of the HIP gas to $\\log\nn_{\\rm H}=7.7^{+0.2}_{-0.9}$ and estimate its distance to be about\n$R=0.45^{+0.80}_{-0.09}$ light-days from the black hole, corresponding to\n$R=4000^{+7000}_{-800}$ gravitational radii.

This paper aims to investigate the acceleration\nduring planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving\ndeeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that\nplanetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration,\nthe more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows\ndown, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more\ndifficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate\ncorresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals\nconsumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that\nNeptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of\nplanetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was\napproximately 0.009$M_{\\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms\nthat can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR\nbetween Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever\nthese two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring\nstructure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in\nthis region can provide the material support necessary for migration\nacceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system\noccupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR\nwith Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore,\nunder the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the\nsolar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather\nthan an inevitable consequence."}

We calculated\nthe visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY,\nand MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the\ninterferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.\nWe explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges\nin distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the\nsource of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the\ncompanion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common\ninterpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a\ncompanion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data,\nas indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions\ncan still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by\nreevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a\nfaint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection\nprobability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the\npreviously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion\nrejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based\non Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This\nhighlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former\nstudies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a\nmethod for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit."}

The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous\nplasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably,\nlower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma\nenvironments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies\nhave primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these\nregions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of\nLHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized\nmedia, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster\nplasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical\nsettings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized\nby the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal\nelectrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we\ndetermine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable\nefficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of\ninstability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further\nanalyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm\nthese critical conditions.

To isolate the impact\nof hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their\nremnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters.\nIn uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit\nbackflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes\nare shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler;\nwhile PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In\nstratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer\nand thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT\njets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long\nfilamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with\nvarying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have\na similar impact on the ambient medium.

The validation or falsification of these predictions\nprovide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal. We confront our\npredictions with Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic\nplane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the\nstatistical properties of the data. The spectral dependence of the covariances\nbetween residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a\ndust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index\nvariations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck\nofficial release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision\npolarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB\ncommunity."}

However, uncertainties and\ndegeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make\nthis task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring\npulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models\nare not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To\naddress this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light\ncurve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that\nencourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given\nlight curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines\npredicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light\ncurve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters\nduring inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art\nsimulated pulsar light curves.

However, the white dwarf\natmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the\ntrue composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted\nmetals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various\nphysical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on\nthe effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline\nmixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated\natmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete\ntreatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in\naccreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including\nthermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems,\nthe effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the\noverall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available\ngrids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a\nlarge impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the\ninferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material.

The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the\nDiffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background\nExplorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However,\nthis model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of\nDIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We\npresent a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical\nforms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of\nwavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths\n(0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB)\nmeasurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions\nof zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than\n80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably,\nthe HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky -\nZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of\nour diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin.\nInstead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be\nincluded in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics", "summary": "Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the\nradiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure\ndownstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\n  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool\nand from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of\nsupernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle\nacceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the\ntotal proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our\nresults indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during\nthe first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated\nmulti-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be\ndetectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is\nfound to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the\ntest-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a\ngrowing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and\nthe effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles\nare confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron\nspectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR\nshock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA\ncan take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total\nelectron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from\nthermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young\nradiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for\nwhich the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} -\n1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA."}

Aim: We aim to investigate the\ninterferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.\nWe explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges\nin distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the\nsource of the observed excess.

Submitted to ApJL", "summary": "AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up\nof the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age\n($\\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr\nclassify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the\nresults of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio\nCanarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time\nevolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset\n($\\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\\sim5$ brighter\nthan AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of\nour kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred\nejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\\lesssim\\!0.87\\!$\nM$_{\\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a\nnearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a\ncolor ($F336W-F160W\\!\\approx\\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a\nkilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova,\ninitially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric\nphase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features."}

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas\nfraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we\nnote that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has\nnot been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}
