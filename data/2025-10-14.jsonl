The majority of these targets are classified as\nHerbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes). All were monitored at optical wavelengths for at\nleast one 27-day TESS sector, with many having multiple sectors of data. From a\ncustom aperture photometry pipeline, we produced light curves and analyzed the\nvariability therein, as a function of stellar and circumstellar properties.\nBased on visual and statistical analysis, we find that ~95% of HAeBes are\nvariable on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 month, with the most common light\ncurve morphology being stochastic. Approximately 15% of the set display\nquasi-periodic variability. In comparison to sets of low-mass T Tauri stars\nmonitored with optical space telescopes, the Herbig Ae/Be stars display a much\nlower incidence of ``dipper\" behaviors (quasi-periodic or aperiodic fading\nevents), as well as periodic modulations. As posited by previous work, we\nconclude that magnetic starspots are rare on HAeBes, and that the inner\ncircumstellar dust rims of these objects lie at substantially larger radii than\nfor low-mass young stars. Beyond these differences, the accretion dynamics of\nyoung stars less than ~7$M_\\odot$ appear to be largely consistent based on\ntheir time domain properties from data streams of up to three months' duration.\nWe do, however, find tentative evidence for a change in variability amplitude\nabove this mass boundary, particularly for quasi-periodic behavior."}

However,\nobtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a\nlong-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of\ngiants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same\ntime and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages\nbased on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang & Rix (2022) are generally\nconsistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional\nuncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that\npublished photometric subgiant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors\nof 2-3. Spectroscopic age estimates for red giant and red clump stars also show\nreliable uncertainties, but are generally less precise (25-30%).

The high level of pollution indicates\nthat substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling.\nWe also detect weak Ca II H & K line-core emission, making this only the second\nknown isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting\nthe presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere.\nOur analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy\nelements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted\nhydrogen-rich white dwarfs.

We present a method to\nsimultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger\ndata stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the\nlikelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this\napproach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the\nRubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a\n~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the\nInternational Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035.

First,\nusing the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess\nthe models against each other using the key background parameters and compare\nthem to the $\\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high\nredshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both\nhomogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region.\nHowever, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into\nthe phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others.\nIn the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM.\nUsing background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including\n$\\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter\nperturbations, $f\\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\\Delta f \\sigma_8$, from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational\ndata, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\\Lambda$CDM.\nFinally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC\nand BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data\ndepends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the\nassumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that\nhomogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than\nclustered DE models."}

Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\\sim$3:1 mass-ratio\nmerger event near redshift $z\\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory.\nThis now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables\nin Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline\ndeveloped within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and\ncovariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series\nof six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid\nprimary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables\nof cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with\nspectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier\nand configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including\nthe wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes\nsystematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic\nfeedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear\ncalibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic\ngalaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are\nfurther able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and\nextended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark\nenergy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions\nthat underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature\nof the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid."}

The dynamo layer, also called the tachocline, permits the existence\nof Rossby waves (r-modes) described by magnetohydrodynamic shallow water\nmodels, which may lead to short-term cycles in stellar activity. Convective\ncells penetrate into the layer creating an overshoot upper part, where they\ntransport an additional energy for vigorous activity. The aim of this paper is\nto study the influence of overshooting convection on the dynamics of Rossby\nwaves in the tachoclines of Sun-like stars. Here we write the\nmagnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the effect of the penetrative\nconvection and study the dynamics of wave modes in the layer. The formalism\nleads to the excitation of new oscillation modes connected with the dynamo\ncoefficient, alpha, causing periodic modulations of all parameters in the\ntachocline. The modes are coupled with the Rossby waves resulting mutual\nexchange of convective and rotation energies. The timescales of Rossby-dynamo\nwaves, for certain parameters, correspond to Schwabe (11 years) and Rieger\n(150-170 days) cycles as observed in solar activity. The waves provide a new\nparadigm for internal magnetism and may drive the dynamos of Sun-like stars.\nTheoretical properties of the waves and observations can be used for\nmagneto-seismological sounding of stellar interiors."}

In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger\nastronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition\nof new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial\neffort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We\npresent a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific\nanalysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and\nwe use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,\noptical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic\nprocedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323\nnearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results\nwith the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human\nintervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9\nof the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the\nphotometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS\nmeasurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100\n{\\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent\ncombination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the\nremaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic\nindication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions.\nIn principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport\nSystem (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an\naccuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is\nstill required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series\nof recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the\nscientific analysis of large astronomical data sets."}

Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband\nand high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize\nboth broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The\nbest-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by\nreflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona,\nmodified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the\nline of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong,\nrelativistically-broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line is required in order to\nobtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence\nof a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find\ntentative evidence for a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and\nindicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a\nnon-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification\nschemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by\nthe best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux\nvariability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation\nof the time-averaged spectra.

Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs)\nis essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their\nevolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides\nmonth-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to\nsearch for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to\nidentify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of\nmagnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out\nto investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for\nvariability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our\nsample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available.\nThe results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the\npreviously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods\nconsistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four\nare asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period,\nthe white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four\nsystems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously\nreported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of\nthe flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise\nlevels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a\nmeasure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our\nvalues for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP\nindicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light\ncurves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the\nreliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS\nmagnitudes $\\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable."}

Specifically, its goal is to shed\nlight on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires\ndeveloping and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction\nsoftware capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we\ndescribe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for\nObservables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative\ncosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary\nprobes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the\nmagnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function\nof galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's\nimplementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive\nneutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation\nof these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic\nEuclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with\nthe results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this\nwork several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could\nbe further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to\nenhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine\nlearning techniques."}

So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by\nusing some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type\nIa supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts\n(FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology\nproposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm\nDM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution\nfunctions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant\n$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current\n${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close\nto its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for\nthe parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a\nsmall $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a\nloose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125\nlocalized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly\npreferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian\nevidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension\nbetween FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of\nmodifying $\\sigma_\\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$, here\nwe try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\\rm\nDM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\\ell$ and $e^\\mu$,\nrespectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018\nand SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria\nAIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\\rm DM_{host}$ are\noverwhelmingly strong."}

The development of these applications can be done\nrapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the\nnecessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established\nwithin agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several\ndivisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and\nINDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model.

Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits\nfluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and\nmay be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold\nsources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky\nregion of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit\nappear to be consistent with background."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ on September\n  22, 2025", "summary": "We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a ~3 Gyr old\nhydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of\nthe Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH,\nsuggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent\nbody exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk\nEarth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM\nJ0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core\nmass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates\nthat substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling.\nWe also detect weak Ca II H & K line-core emission, making this only the second\nknown isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting\nthe presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere.\nOur analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy\nelements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted\nhydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts\nthe inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived\nstellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared\nexcess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring\ndisk model."}

X-ray observations, primarily from Chandra\nand XMM-Newton, have revealed a wealth of information about the thermodynamics\nof this gas. However, two regimes remain difficult to study with current\ninstruments: superheated gas well above 10~keV generated by shocks from major\nmergers, and distant systems strongly impacted by cosmological dimming.\nRelativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (rSZe) produce a\nfractional spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background at\nsub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths that could offer a complimentary\nprobe of both high temperature and high redshift ICM gas. Here we describe\nmulti-band measurements of the rSZe, including observations from the Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer on the Herschel-SPIRE instrument, that constrain the ICM\nthermodynamics of the major merger MACSJ0717.5+3745.

In this study, we present\nthe first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables\nin Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this\nendeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic\nEuclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and\nnuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary\nprobes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy\nlensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of\nCLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential\nto achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$\nexceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the\nbehaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of\ninterest given different priors and scale cuts.

Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of\ntransients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims.\nWe investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous\nsupernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \\sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the\nlower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in\na faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \\simeq -14.5$ AB.\nMethods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and\nimaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the\ndata are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons\nwith other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN\n2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The\nbolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5\nx10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy\nmodeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a\nSLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling\nshows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive\nsource ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve\nevolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the\nexplosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej} \\sim 0.24 ~M_\\odot$) took place in a\nlow mass ($M \\sim 10^{6.66}~M_\\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation\nrate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions.\nGiven its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its\nlight-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe\nTypes. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu\nand SN 2018gep."}

The\nformation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within\nthem to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular,\nthe role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and\nprestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we\nconduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant\nmolecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the\ninterstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving\ndown to scales $\\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By\nintroducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas\nduring its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how\nmuch of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the\ngravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is\ngravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the\nwarm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular\nclouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\\gtrsim 400$\ncm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas\non the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions\nassembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven\nsupersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small\ncontribution from the stellar gravitational potential."}

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

This paper investigates the differences in abundance\nevolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic\nchemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy\narises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean\nGalactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar\nmetallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined\nwith increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy\nexists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We\ndemonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise\nmeasurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in\nthe Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and\nlower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently\nprecise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of\nnon-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical\nconstraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis.

Mota"], "title": "Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A and M83 from TGRB Distances", "comment": "13 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial in light of\nthe persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this\nstudy, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies,\nalong with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red\nGiant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and\nthe local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative\nto the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models,\nwhich provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these\napproaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \\pm 2) \\times 10^{12}\\,\nM_{\\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{12}\\,\nM_{\\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we\nderive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \\pm\n5~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent,\ndynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly\naccounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We\nalso discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass\nestimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity\nsurface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit\nemphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the\nvelocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of\nbound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83\ntotal mass."}
