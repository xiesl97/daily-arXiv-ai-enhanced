The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $\u03b3$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501.

We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6(TDEs)X\u5c04\u7ebf\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5206\u949f\u81f3\u5c0f\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u542b\u5195\u7684TDEs\u6bd4\u7eaf\u70ed\u6e90\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u8c31\u66f4\u9661\uff1b\u65b0\u751fTDE\u5195\u7684PSD\u66f4\u5e73\u4e14\u5149\u8c31\u66f4\u8f6f\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u957f\u5bff\u547dAGN\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22TDEs\u4e2dX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u5fae\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4TDE\u5195\u4e0eAGN\u5195\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528XMM-Newton\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf18\u4e2aTDEs\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u3001\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6(PSDs)\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5e45\u5ea6\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u542b\u5195TDEs\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14PSDs\u66f4\u9661\uff1b\u65b0\u751fTDE\u5195PSDs\u66f4\u5e73\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u66f4\u8f6f\uff1b\u70edTDEs\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u968f\u5149\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408X\u5c04\u7ebfTDEs\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u63a2\u7a76\u65b0\u5f62\u6210\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\u7684\u5fae\u7269\u7406\uff0cTDE\u5195\u4e0eAGN\u5195\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example.

Comments welcome", "summary": "We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\\%$ complete to $m_g\\sim20$ mag and $M_\\star \\sim 10^6$ $M_\\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation.

We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with $q(\\frac{h_p}{r_p})^{(-1)}(\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p})^{(a-\\frac{b}{2}-2)}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, $\\frac{h_p}{r_p}$ is the disk aspect ratio, $\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p}$ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and $a$ and $b$ are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%.

Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours.

This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\u0394g \\sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\\rm trigger} \\simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\\sim5-12.3 R_\\star$).

One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs.

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia.

Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case.

We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830~\u00c5~line.

The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53c2\u6570(KSP)\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316NANOGrav\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7KSP\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5bf968\u9897\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4(TOA)\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97KSP\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660eKSP\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u968f\u673a\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \\pm 0.042\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \\pm 0.108\\,M_{\\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases.

The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \\approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfv\u00e9nic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfv\u00e9n speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfv\u00e9n speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0e2023\u5e745\u670814\u65e5\u7684CME\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u591a\u4e2aII\u578b\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65e5\u5195\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9aII\u578b\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u548cCME\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6ce2\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408GOES-SUVI\u3001SOHO-LASCO\u548c\u767d\u5149\u53ca\u6781\u7d2b\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5730\u9762I-LOFAR\u768410-240MHz\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PFSS\u548cMHD\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u5195\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u4e2aII\u578b\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a443-2075 km/s\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\u4e3a-361\u81f3-78 kHz/s\uff0c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u8d85\u963f\u5c14\u82ac\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8eCME\u4fa7\u7ffc\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u78c1\u529b\u7ebf\u548c\u4f4e\u963f\u5c14\u82ac\u901f\u5ea6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4eea\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aCME\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2aII\u578b\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0eCME\u4fa7\u7ffc\u7684\u4f4e\u963f\u5c14\u82ac\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u78c1\u529b\u7ebf\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9502\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u661f\u7cfb\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9502\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6052\u661f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u9502\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9502\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u9502\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u9502\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u603b\u7ed3\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9502\u4e30\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u6052\u661f\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9502\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9502\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u4ee5\u53ca\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5f84\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u8003\u8651\u5316\u5b66\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6240\u6709\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u9502\u4e30\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u9502\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u6052\u661f\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9502\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9502\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9502\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u6052\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u9502\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical S\u00c3\\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\\rm S\\acute{e}rsic} \\sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528HST\u548cJWST\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u56db\u91cd\u900f\u955c\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u50cf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u578b\u548c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u91cd\u900f\u955c\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u578b\u548c\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5bf9\u89c6\u573a\u4e2d\u5355\u661f\u7cfb\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u900f\u955c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7HST\u548cJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56db\u91cd\u900f\u955c\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u7b49\u6e29\u692d\u7403\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u548cS\u00e9rsic\u692d\u5706\u5149\u5256\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u7ea2\u79fb\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u5178\u578b\u7684de Vaucouleurs\u5149\u5256\uff08$n_{\\rm S\u00e9rsic} \\sim 4$\uff09\u548c\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84$R_e$\u7ea6\u4e3a1.5-3.5\u5343\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7ea2\u79fb\u8303\u56f4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.5-1.2\u30011.0-1.5\u548c0.4-0.9\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u7c7b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u900f\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u900f\u955c\u661f\u7cfb\u662f\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u65e9\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5df2\u77e5\u56db\u91cd\u900f\u955c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u900f\u955c\u5de1\u5929\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q > 40 au) and high-i (i > 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a > 245 au), low-i detached (i < 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i < 20 deg), and extreme (q > 50 au or i > 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at ~150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs.

Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\\parallel} \\ge [k_\\parallel]_f=0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\\perp},k_{2\\perp},k_{3\\perp},k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \\perp},k_{2 \\perp},k_{3 \\perp})\\leq 0.026~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel},k_{3\\parallel})>0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\u0394^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\u0394^3_{\\rm LL}=-(1.25\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\u0394^3_{\\rm UL}=(1.22\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027Vlasov-Maxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95f4\u65adGalerkin\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5982QED\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u653e\u7535\u3001\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u5f3a\u78c1\u5316\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u78c1\u91cd\u8054\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u95f4\u65adGalerkin\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u5b88\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u72ec\u7279\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u7531\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times (~0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after ~0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $\u03b1_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $\u03bb_{Edd}$, with a break at $\u03bb_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Seyfert\u661f\u7cfbMarkarian 590\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5438\u79ef\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5176\u4ece1975\u5e74\u81f32025\u5e74\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7f55\u89c1AGN\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Markarian 590\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e00\u4e2aAGN\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u7406\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528Swift\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790X\u5c04\u7ebf\u786c\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u56fe\uff08HID\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7X\u5c04\u7ebf\u54cd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570$\u03b1_{ox}$\u4e0e\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4$\u03bb_{Edd}$\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cMkn 590\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u4ece\u6697\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u4eaeUV/\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c$\u03b1_{ox}$\u4e0e$\u03bb_{Edd}$\u5448'V'\u5f62\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9\u4e3a$\u03bb_{Edd}$=0.021\u3002\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e3a10\u5e74\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u8584\u76d8\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u7c98\u6ede\u65f6\u6807\u4f46\u7b26\u5408\u5185\u76d8\u70ed\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\uff0cMkn 590\u7684\u659c\u7387\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u5e73\u576670%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u9ad8\u6548\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u65e5\u5195-\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9eMkn 590\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u8fa8AGN\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u8c31\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds.

Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest.

Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\u03c3$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\\rm F444W} - m_{\\rm F560W} \\ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\\% and completeness of 54\\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate.

Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products", "comment": "Revised version submitted to A&A", "summary": "The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations.

These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u571f\u661f\u536b\u661f\u6cf0\u5766\u4e0e\u5730\u7403\u5728\u5730\u8d28\u548c\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cf0\u5766\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u4e2d\u552f\u4e00\u4e0e\u5730\u7403\u5728\u5730\u8d28\u548c\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5929\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u6c14\u3001\u964d\u6c34\u3001\u5730\u8868\u6c34\u7cfb\u548c\u5580\u65af\u7279\u5730\u5f62\u7b49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u62d3\u5c55\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u548c\u6cf0\u5766\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cf0\u5766\u548c\u5730\u7403\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u4e0e\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\uff08field analog research\uff09\u6765\u8865\u5145\u6cf0\u5766\u6709\u9650\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6cf0\u5766\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5730\u7403\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u5730\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6cf0\u5766\u63a2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts.

The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86113\u4e2a\u5b64\u7acb\u661f\u7cfbCGM\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u6cbf\u76d8\u9762\u6781\u65b9\u5411\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u4f4d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5bf9CGM\u4e2dH I\u548cO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u4e0eCGM\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MUSEQuBES\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790H I\u548cO VI\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528TPCF\u7814\u7a76O VI\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfbH I\u548cO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u6cbf\u76d8\u9762\u548c\u6781\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfbO VI\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u65e0\u65b9\u4f4d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1bO VI\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6cbf\u76d8\u9762\u66f4\u7a84\u3002", "conclusion": "O VI\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u661f\u7cfb\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u6765\u6e90\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8868\u660eCGM\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6655\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8d85\u6697\u81f4\u5bc6\u536b\u661f\uff08UFCSs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9UFCSs\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u8d77\u6e90\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u6837\u672c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u6781\u7aef\u536b\u661f\u7fa4\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Magellan/IMACS\u548cKeck/DEIMOS\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e8619\u4e2aUFCSs\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5f25\u6563\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eGaia\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0UFCSs\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8eUFDs\uff0c\u5316\u5b66\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\uff08\u94c1\u4e30\u5ea6\u8de8\u5e45\u8fbe300\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u8fc4\u4eca\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "UFCSs\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7ea650%\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002"}}
