Contradictory answers appear in the\nliterature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a\nsharply truncated edge: the surface density $\\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge,\nand the $\\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it\nvanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out\nof the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An\nedge where $\\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed\nfor astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by\nHunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in\nthree ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by\nsolving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion\nrelation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB.

However, the small PSF\nsize provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making\nit difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions\nunusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each\nexposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4\narcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF\nexhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.\nAdditionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the\nfilters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS.

With our large sample, we\nstatistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with\nvarying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the\nrichest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust\ntemperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\\textit{L/M}) ratios, and\nmost massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at\nlater evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of\ncores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their\nsurrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is\nweaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at\nhigher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete\nmass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the\ntotal available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a\nclump-fed core accretion model."}

Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or\nr-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This\nclassification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element\nabundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements\nsuch as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium\nhave rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the\nultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i-\nnucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure\nclassification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process\ncan account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the\nabundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some\ncases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs\nstars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the\nmodel-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and\nsix as CEMP-s.

This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux."}

The method starts with\nderivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the\ninterferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using\nself-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains\n(i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking\ninterferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\\mu$m and\n3.8~$\\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration,\nnear-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based\namplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source\ncalibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary\nWolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\\sim 240$ on\nthe target, and $\\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short\nintegration.

Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two\nwavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the\nexpected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star.\nIncluding a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the\nfinal images by about 23\\%."}

Bubble Overlap at Redshift z ~ 7 in LAGER-z7OD1", "comment": null, "summary": "Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era\nLyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the\nneutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing\nvariance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field\nfluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we\npresent new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~\n7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The\nerrorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our\nresults are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster."}

The classical\nswing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar\ninstability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation\nprocess or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies\nfound that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass\nfraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as \"Fujii relation\"), but they only\nexplored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$\n(local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are\nnot fully explored.

Contradictory answers appear in the\nliterature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a\nsharply truncated edge: the surface density $\\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge,\nand the $\\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it\nvanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out\nof the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An\nedge where $\\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed\nfor astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by\nHunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps.

While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence.

A broader degeneracy exists among\ninitial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel\n(monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and\nblack hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion\nenables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within\nthe tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate\nto slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas\nexpulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity\ndistribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which\ngoverns both cluster mass loss and black hole retention.

Using classifier-based architectures\nenhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic\nmodels that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline\nmethods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when\nfine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective\nzero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future\ntelescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF)\ndata. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena\n(namely variable stars from NASA's \\textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being\ntrained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our\napproach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled\ndata is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations."}

Besides the black\nhole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the\nfeatures also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of\nX-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model\nfor spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the\naccretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection\nspectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational\naxis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations,\nthis geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the\ncorona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection\nmodel RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source.\nWith the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary\nsource in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and\ndiscuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then\napply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the\nradio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well,\nand we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be\nless than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source\nis poorly constrained.

We use two-dimensional\nhydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source,\nvarying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We\npost-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport\ncode to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the\ncentre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently\npowerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and\naccelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of\nthe engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing\nhigh-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical\nimpact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon\nescape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of\nlow-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially\nhot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic\nsupernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity\nmaterial near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow\nemission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how\nvariability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise\nto a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes,\nincluding the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and\nsuperluminous supernovae."}

To evaluate the fitness of the\ntheoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical\nproperties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves\nusing five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data\npoints. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the\nsum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a\nsimulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of\nsimulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic\nreconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux\nand polarization dynamics.

They occur when a high-energy secondary particle,\nthe leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a\ndistinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been\nable to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of\ndouble-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way\nto reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense\nantenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory\n(SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features,\noffering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain\nparticle cross sections at high energies.\n  In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for\nradio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to\nidentify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal\nprofiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers\nacross different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction\nmodels. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles\nwith at least $1\\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading\nparticle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles.\nThis will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to\nmeasurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio\nfootprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern,\nconsisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles\ncan be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will\nbe the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail."}

The extended code self-consistently evolves\nnuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino\nradiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's\nequations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source\nterms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is\nperformed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a\ntabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic\ntests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia\nsupernovae.

This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux."}
