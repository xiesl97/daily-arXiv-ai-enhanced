Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR} \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\\rm jet} \\gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528IceCube 12.5\u5e74\u9ad8\u80fd\u8d77\u59cb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf989\u4e2a\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u636e\u6b64\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86TDEs\u55b7\u6d41\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDEs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5019\u9009\u6e90\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\u3001\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea7\u751fTeV-PeV\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IceCube 12.5\u5e74\u9ad8\u80fd\u8d77\u59cb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e89\u4e2aTDEs\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u672a\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7ea6\u675f\u55b7\u6d41\u6bd4\u4f8b$f_{\\rm jet} \\gtrsim 0.6$\u65f6\uff0c\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf$\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm CR} \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{53}$ erg\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea690%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u6bb5\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982IceCube\u548cKM3NeT\uff09\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ea6\u675fTDEs\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002"}}

These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u4e2d\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6e4d\u6d41\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u4f5c\u7528\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u78c1\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u4e2d\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5408\u540e\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u7a7a\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u521d\u59cb\u5f31\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8Kelvin-Helmholtz\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u653e\u5927\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5e76\u5408\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u7acb\u5373\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u4e14\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u4e14\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u540e\u7acb\u5373\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u540e\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability.\n  Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds.\n  HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science.", "AI": {"tldr": "Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u7c7b\u5730\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9c\u5c45\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "HWO\u662f2040\u5e74\u4ee3\u8ba1\u5212\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u4e91\u5c42\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5b9c\u5c45\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "HWO\u5c06\u914d\u5907\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u4eea\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u4eea\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u4e91\u5c42\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u5c42\u7c92\u5b50\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347HWO\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u82f1\u56fd\u5728\u4eea\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u9886\u5bfc\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8baeHWO\u7eb3\u5165\u504f\u632f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u79d1\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u82f1\u56fd\u5728\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002"}}

Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\"\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u975e\u51cc\u65e5\u53ca\u51cc\u65e5\u5ca9\u77f3\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u6ce2\u548c\u77ed\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u6bd4\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u533a\u5206\u884c\u661f\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eJWST\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5ca9\u77f3\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6052\u661f\u9ed1\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u6591\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b21\u98df\u89c2\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u7684\u786e\u5207\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u884c\u661f\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u957f\uff08\u598221\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8f83\u77ed\u6ce2\u957f\uff08\u598212\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\u7684\u5149\u6bd4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5f3a\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u6ce2\u957f\uff08\u598215\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9000\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8d28\u5f84\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7eb5\u5411\u70ed\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9694\u79bb\u884c\u661f\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u6291\u5236\u6052\u661f\u53ca\u4eea\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u51cc\u65e5\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e3a\u672a\u6765RV\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u975e\u51cc\u65e5\u6e29\u5e26\u5ca9\u77f3\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We present 3-8 micron light curves extending 27 years from 1997 to 2024 obtained with three space-based IR telescopes: ISO, Spitzer and WISE. Although unevenly sampled with large gaps in coverage, these light curves show variability on time scales ranging from days to decades. We focus on the Spitzer-identified YSOs with disks and envelopes that exhibit variations of a factor of two or more in this wavelength range. We identified seven YSOs where the light curves are dominated by bursts of sustained (> 5 yr) high flux, including four that show a steep decay ending the burst and three that are ongoing as of the final observation. We find six YSOs that are undergoing declines, which may be the end of bursts that began before 1997. The most common form of variability, exhibited by 26 YSOs in our sample, show variations over time intervals of years to months but do not exhibit sustained bursts or fades.

All analysis scripts/notebooks available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18195695", "summary": "Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\u03c0\\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

We report the first-ever constraints on such sources based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization measurements. Using data from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck, and WMAP, we constrain the amplitude of an early causal tensor (ECT) power spectrum parameterized by $r_{ect}$, the ratio of causal tensor power to total scalar power at $k~=~0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and obtain a 95% CL upper limit of $r_{ect}<$ 0.0077. Since $r_{ect}$ can easily be related to the parameters of a given theory, our bound robustly constrains a broad class of well-motivated gravitational wave sources in the early universe, including first-order cosmological phase transitions, enhanced small-scale density perturbations, and various topological defects.

In order to maximize the scientific return, we need a well thought strategy for selecting the observational targets, in our case exoplanets. This study evaluates various strategies for selecting exoplanet targets within limited observation windows, focusing specifically on the selection of exoplanet targets for Tier 2 transit spectroscopy with ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. We define three distinct selection criteria -- sample size, variance, and leverage -- and translate them into objective functions compatible with modern optimization algorithms. Specifically, we test five heuristics for maximizing sample leverage: leverage greedy, simulated annealing, K-means clustering, regular classes, and quantile classes. The performance of these methods is demonstrated through three practical exercises across one, two, and three parameters of diversity. Each criterion represents a unique trade-off between sample size, diversity, and total observation time. While a time-greedy approach maximizes the quantity of planets, it fails to capture diversity. Conversely, variance-greedy selection prioritizes diversity but introduces significant drawbacks: it oversamples rare cases and undersamples typical planets, ultimately reducing the total number of targets observed. Leverage-based selections emerge as the most effective middle ground, successfully balancing sample diversity with a robust sample size. This work supports the broader community effort to ensure that Ariel delivers the most diverse and scientifically valuable sample of exoplanet atmospheres within mission limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u9009\u62e9\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u9488\u5bf9Ariel\u4efb\u52a1\u7684Tier 2\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6760\u6746\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6760\u6746\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6760\u6746\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9Ariel\u4efb\u52a1\u7684Tier 2\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6760\u6746\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6760\u6746\u8d2a\u5a6a\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u3001K\u5747\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7ec3\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u884c\u661f\u6570\u91cf\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u65b9\u5dee\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5148\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f46\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6760\u6746\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6760\u6746\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u786e\u4fddAriel\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u9650\u5236\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5177\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Here, we searched for fast-rotating stars on the main sequence of open clusters using Kepler, TESS, and spectroscopic rotation indicators, such as rotation periods and $v\\sin i$ measurements. We identified 97 new BL candidates across 35 open clusters, almost tripling the previously known sample of 36. Based on the estimated completeness of $\\approx$3\\%, thousands of BLs are likely hidden within the cluster population. Detailed spectroscopic and time-series analyses will be essential to confirm their mass-transfer histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8697\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u201c\u84dd\u8272\u6f5c\u884c\u8005\u201d\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u7740\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u6b64\u7c7b\u5929\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u201c\u84dd\u8272\u6f5c\u884c\u8005\u201d\uff08BLs\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5929\u4f53\u662f\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u6216\u5408\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u989c\u8272-\u661f\u7b49\u56fe\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Kepler\u3001TESS\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u65cb\u8f6c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u548c$v\\sin i$\u6d4b\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522bBL\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u572835\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8697\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684BL\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u662f\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8fd1\u4e09\u500d\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u7ea63%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5ea6\uff0c\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u6570\u5343\u4e2aBLs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9bBLs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u5386\u53f2\u786e\u8ba4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u56e0\u679c\u5f20\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\uff08ECTs\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982CMB B\u6a21\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7ea2\u5916\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\uff08ECTs\uff09\u7684\u666e\u9002\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5176\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u4ea7\u751f\u7684B\u6a21\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790ECTs\u7684\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5178\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "result": "ECTs\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u666e\u9002\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176B\u6a21\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51faECTs\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5f20\u91cf\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7a84\u7ebf\u585e\u5f17\u72791\uff08NLS1\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b50\u4e2aNLS1\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5c04\u7535\u8c31\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76NLS1\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u751a\u5927\u9635\uff08JVLA\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b50\u4e2aNLS1\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d20\u4e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5c04\u7535\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "24\u4e2a\u6e90\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6e90\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9661\u8c31\uff0c\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e42\u5f8b\u8c31\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff1b\u91cd\u590d\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6e90\u672a\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "NLS1\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u8c31\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u5916\u6d41\u6216\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u9610\u660e\u5176\u5c04\u7535\u8d77\u6e90\u3002"}}

Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements. The sky-position chopper was positioned on a motor-controlled stage for fine-tuned control over its position and alignment. Thanks to the multiplexing capability of KIDs, we could simultaneously measure multiple performance metrics across the entire frequency range.

Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b.

During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\\sim$86$\\pm7~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\\sim$295$\\pm20~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e862023\u5e749\u67081\u65e5\u81f314\u65e5\u671f\u95f4Solar Orbiter SoloHI\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684C/2023 P1\u5f57\u661f\u79bb\u5b50\u5c3e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56db\u6b21\u5c3e\u65ad\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e9\u670811\u65e5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u89c2\u6d4bTDE\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CME\u4e0e\u5f57\u5c3e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u518d\u751f\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u5728\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7Solar Orbiter SoloHI\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0CME\u4e0e\u5f57\u661f\u79bb\u5b50\u5c3e\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c3e\u65ad\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u518d\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790SoloHI\u7684\u767d\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u5f57\u661f\u79bb\u5b50\u5c3e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f9\u670811\u65e5\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u5c3e\u65ad\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CME\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c3e\u65ad\u88c2\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u518d\u751f\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5265\u79bb\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3e\u65ad\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0eCME\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u65ad\u88c2\u540e\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u5c3e\u5728\u7ea624\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u4ee586\u00b17 km/s\u7684\u901f\u7387\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u5265\u79bb\u5c3e\u90e8\u4ee5295\u00b120 km/s\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u5411\u592a\u9633\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e0eCME\u4fa7\u7ffc\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u5f57\u661f-CME\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176TDE\u518d\u751f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SoloHI\u5728\u5f57\u5c3e\u52a8\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f57\u661f\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff08SFR\uff09\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u529f\u7387\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u97e6\u4f2f\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08JWST\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\uff08z > 4\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u548c\u989c\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\uff08SFH\uff09\u6ce2\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9000\u5316\u548c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u968f\u673aSFH\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e3a1 Myr-10 Gyr\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62dfN=500\u4e2az~4\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5e26\u6709JWST/NIRSpec\u5178\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\uff08i\uff09SFR\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u529f\u7387\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u62df\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u8fd1\u671fSFH\u659c\u7387\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u7206\u53d1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u4f30\u6ce2\u52a8\u529f\u7387\uff1b\uff08iv\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u7206\u53d1\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u6ce2\u52a8\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u5747\u5300\u5149\u8c31\u6837\u672c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\u039b$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe.

Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u4e86B.

Hereafter, we call it ``G1010''. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other. The primary star is a $0.85_{-0.03}^{+0.03}\\;{\\rm M}_\\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star, and the inner binary components are $0.63_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ and $0.61_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\\;{\\rm M}_\\odot$ MS stars. The outer and inner orbital periods are $277.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ and $\\sim 18.26$ days, respectively. G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u4e09\u5408\u661f\u7cfb\u7edfG1010\uff0c\u7531\u4e00\u9897\u4e3b\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u53cc\u661f\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u548cTESS\u5149\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5176\u4f34\u968f\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76G1010\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408Gaia\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5206\u5c42\u4e09\u5408\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6b21\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790G1010\u7684\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408TESS\u5149\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u5185\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4G1010\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u4e09\u5408\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5185\u53cc\u661f\u4e3a\u63a9\u98df\u53cc\u661f\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5176\u4f34\u968f\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5185\u5916\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3cG1010\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u4e09\u5408\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5149\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ed3\u5408Gaia\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency.

Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u6655\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u526a\u5207\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u5916\u94f6\u6cb3\u80cc\u666f\u5149\uff08EBL\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5206\uff08IGL\u3001IHL\u548cEoR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SPHEREx\u548cEuclid\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "EBL\u5728\u5149\u5b66/\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8c31\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u6210\u5206\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u526a\u5207/\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5206\u89e3EBL\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u5408\u6655\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5305\u542b10\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff080.75-5.0 \u03bcm\uff09\u548c6\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u5206\u533a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528MCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u62df\u5408\u81ea\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u529f\u7387\u8c31\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3IGL\u3001IHL\u548cEoR\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "SPHEREx\u548cEuclid\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5c06IHL\u53c2\u6570\u76841\u03c3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8610-35%\uff0cEoR\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620-35%\uff0c\u4e14IHL\u4e0e\u526a\u5207\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86EBL\u5404\u6210\u5206\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5b87\u5b99\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\u03b3$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\\rm L,0}(\u0394T_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LHAASO\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684NGC 4278\u661f\u7cfbTeV\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86AGN\u55b7\u6d41\u548c\u98ce\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08LLAGN\uff09NGC 4278\u4e2dTeV\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9X\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001GeV\u548cTeV\u8f90\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u6790TeV\u4f4e\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u6001\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u55b7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f7b\u5b50-\u5f3a\u5b50\u98ce\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f90\u5c04\u80fd\u8c31\u53ef\u7531\u4e2d\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u8f7b\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u4e9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u98ce\u7684\u8f7b\u5b50-\u5f3a\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u53ca\u55b7\u6d41\u6216\u98ce\u6269\u5f20\u5171\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765MeV\u53ca\u6781\u9ad8\u80fd\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8f7b\u5b50-\u5f3a\u5b50\u98ce\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91caNGC 1068\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u89e3\u91caPeV\u5f25\u6563\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u80cc\u666f\u3002"}}

The evolutionary history of sub-Neptunes on a population level has been proposed as a method to distinguish between the possible bulk compositions. Previous evolutionary models, however, neglected the crucial role of chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior. We present a novel evolution framework for sub-Neptunes that not only considers the thermal evolution but also takes the chemical coupling of atmosphere and interior into account. Using this model, we examine how planets formed inside and outside the ice line can be observationally distinguished. Young sub-Neptunes store the majority of their volatile budget in the interior, independent of formation location and thus initial composition. Nevertheless, the atmospheric metallicity is a factor 4 higher for the planet formed outside the ice line. As the planet cools, hydrogen and oxygen exsolve from the interior, leading to an increase in atmosphere mass fraction for both planets, counteracting the contraction due to cooling. Consequently, radius evolution alone cannot distinguish sub-Neptunes formed inside the water ice line from water-rich planets formed outside of it. Instead, a key discriminator is the abundance of carbon-bearing species and the resulting atmospheric C/O ratio. For water-rich sub-Neptunes formed outside the \\ice line, almost all carbon is in the gaseous phase. We find that high molar fractions of CH$_4$ ($\\>10^{-2}$) and H$_2$O ($> 5\\times10^{-2}$), and a high C/O ratio $(> 5\\times10^{-1})$ are indicative of formation outside the ice line. In contrast, sub-Neptunes formed inside the ice line exhibit strongly suppressed CH$_4$ abundances, yielding C/O ratios ranging widely from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$.

The time-series spectra yielded the radial velocities (RVs) of the primary component and its atmospheric parameters, $T_{\\rm eff,A}=7194\\pm70$ K and $v_{\\rm A}\\sin i=68\\pm9$ km s$^{-1}$. Joint modeling of our RVs and the archival TESS data provided component masses of $M_{\\rm A}=1.930\\pm0.054$ $M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm B}=0.211\\pm0.005$ $M_\\odot$, radii of $R_{\\rm A}=1.922\\pm0.020$ $R_\\odot$ and $R_{\\rm B}=0.207\\pm0.005$ $R_\\odot$, and luminosities of $L_{\\rm A}=8.87\\pm0.39$ $L_\\odot$ and $L_{\\rm B}=0.546\\pm0.034$ $L_\\odot$. The surface gravity and distance derived from this modeling are consistent with the model-independent $\\log g_{\\rm B}$ obtained from the direct observables and with the Gaia distance. The third light of $l_3=0.136\\pm0.003$ comes mainly from two neighboring stars, TIC 399725539 and TIC 399725544. Comparison with stellar models indicates that TIC 399725538 A lies within the instability region of $\u03b4$ Sct$-$$\u03b3$ Dor hybrids, whereas its extremely low-mass companion is markedly underluminous compared to theoretical white dwarf (WD) counterparts. Multifrequency analysis of the binary-subtracted residual lights revealed three significant signals, two of which correspond to aliases at two and four times the dominant frequency $f_1=0.0848$ day$^{-1}$. The $f_1$ frequency is likely a $\u03b3$ Dor-type pulsation arising from the brighter A component, though further confirmation is required. Our results demonstrate that TIC 399725538 is a short-period EL CVn system belonging to the thick-disk population, consisting of a main-sequence $\u03b3$ Dor pulsator and a helium-core WD precursor formed through stable mass transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u97e9\u56fd\u548c\u6cf0\u56fd\u7684\u5149\u6805\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e86TIC 399725538\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3a\u4e00\u9897\u539a\u76d8\u661f\u7fa4\u7684\u77ed\u5468\u671fEL CVn\u578b\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u9897\u4e3b\u5e8f\u03b3 Dor\u8109\u52a8\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u9897\u6c26\u6838\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "EL CVn\u578b\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4bTIC 399725538\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u591a\u8272\u5149\u53d8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u97e9\u56fd\u548c\u6cf0\u56fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7684echelle\u5149\u8c31\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e3b\u661f\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u6e29\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7ed3\u5408TESS\u6863\u6848\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5149\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0TIC 399725538\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6781\u4f4e\u4e14\u5149\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6b8b\u4f59\u5149\u53d8\u7684\u591a\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u03b3 Dor\u578b\u8109\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "TIC 399725538\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u77ed\u5468\u671fEL CVn\u578b\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u9897\u03b3 Dor\u8109\u52a8\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u9897\u6c26\u6838\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u524d\u8eab\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Auriga\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u65e9\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5219\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Auriga\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u91cd\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u3001\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u5f62\u6210\u8f83\u65e9\uff1b\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5e76\u5408\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u7387\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u90e8\u91cd\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u662f\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002"}}

In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\u03bc$ and $\u03a3$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\u03c8$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\u03c8$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\u03bc$ and $\u03a3$ close to 1.

Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites.

To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\u03b1$, and H$\u03b1$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\u03b1}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\u03b1$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \\Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback.

The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\u03b1= -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\u03b1\\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported.

HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models.

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f533I/ATLAS\u7684\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u5f97\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u622a\u9762\u79ef\u4e58\u79ef\u4e3a0.22\u00b10.07 km\u00b2\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a1.3\u00b10.2 km\u3002\u5149\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6838\u5f62\u72b6\u8f74\u6bd4\u22652:1\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u22651\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5bf9\u5411\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u524d\uff0c3I/ATLAS\u5728\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u540e\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u51cf\u5f31\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f533I/ATLAS\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u7b49\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6d3b\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u5bf9\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5185\u5f57\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08HST\uff09\u57282025\u5e7412\u6708\u81f32026\u5e741\u6708\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6838\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u5206\u67903I/ATLAS\u7684\u6838\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001\u5bf9\u5411\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u53ca\u5c18\u57c3\u5f57\u53d1\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u659c\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u524d\u540e\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u5f97\u6838\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u622a\u9762\u79ef\u4e58\u79ef\u4e3a0.22\u00b10.07 km\u00b2\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5178\u578b\u5f57\u6838\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4e3a0.04\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u4e3a1.3\u00b10.2 km\u3002\u5149\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6838\u8f74\u6bd4\u22652:1\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u22651\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5bf9\u5411\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5e45\u5ea6\u7ea60.2\u661f\u7b49\uff0c\u5bbd\u5ea63\u00b0\u00b11\u00b0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u5f57\u53d1\u5c18\u57c3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u659c\u7387\u4e3a0.026\u00b10.006 mag/\u5ea6\u30023I/ATLAS\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u540e\u6d3b\u52a8\u51cf\u5f31\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u6307\u6570\u4e3a4.5\u00b10.3\u3002", "conclusion": "3I/ATLAS\u7684\u6838\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5176\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c3I\u7684\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u672a\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfv\u00e9n waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u78c1\u901a\u7ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u5f84\u5411\u5256\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u901f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u56fa\u5b9a\u65e5\u5195\u57fa\u78c1\u529b\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u98ce\u901f\u4ecd\u56e0\u81a8\u80c0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u7ea6300 km/s\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6574\u4e2a\u65e5\u5195\u533a\u57df\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "WS\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fd1\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f2a\u6d41\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u901f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u4eba\u4e3a\u963f\u5c14\u82ac\u6ce2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6e90\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3MHD\u65b9\u7a0b\u81f370\u500d\u592a\u9633\u534a\u5f84\u5904\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u52a0\u901f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u65e5\u5195\u57fa\u78c1\u529b\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\u65f6\uff0c\u98ce\u901f\u4ecd\u56e0\u81a8\u80c0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6216\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u81a8\u80c0\u53d8\u5316\u7ea6300 km/s\uff1b\u78c1\u901a\u7ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u5f84\u5411\u5256\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6bd4\u6e10\u8fd1\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u98ce\u901f\u66f4\u5177\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u65e5\u5195\u533a\u57df\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u56e0\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u901f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as $ugrizH\u03b1$ data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 10.3$], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\\langle T_{\\rm UV}\\rangle$~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $\u03c4\\lesssim 1500$ Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot})\\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z>4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5bf9Perseus\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\uff08ETGs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\uff08SFH\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176FUV\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u8981\u7531UV upturn\u73b0\u8c61\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e14\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3002\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08z~5\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0eJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76Perseus\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u578b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u548cUV upturn\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u8d77\u6e90\u53ca\u4e0eJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Euclid\u3001GALEX\u3001AstroSat/UVIT\u548cCFHT\u7b49\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SED\u62df\u5408\u5de5\u5177CIGALE\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u679059\u4e2aETGs\u7684SFH\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf96\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684ETGs\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684SED\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "1. \u591a\u6570ETGs\u7684FUV\u8f90\u5c04\u9700UV upturn\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u6e29\u5ea6~33800 K\uff09\uff1b2.

The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets.

This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ should be below $\\sim 10\\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements.

Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows.

We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3.

Submitted to AJ", "summary": "Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe / H]}<-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe/H]} < -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$.

Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \\emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\u03b5_{\\rm B}$ of the magnetic field).

We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PERTURB-c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5730\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5730\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5feb\u901f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "PERTURB-c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u56fe\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e00\u7ef4\u5927\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "PERTURB-c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PERTURB-c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 (\u03c3 = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from ~ 13 Gyr to ~ 1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y ~ 0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86233\u9897M 54\u6210\u5458\u661f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff08Fe\u3001Mg\u3001Al\u3001Si\u3001K\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u652f\u6301M 54\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u5408\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22M 54\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5e74\u9f84\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLT\u7684FLAMES\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u5206\u6790\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "M 54\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5927\uff08\u591a\u6570[Fe/H]\u4ecb\u4e8e-1.8\u81f3-1.0\uff09\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u5e03\u5e7f\uff0813 Gyr\u81f31-2 Gyr\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bcc\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684H\u71c3\u70e7\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "M 54\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u5408\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u661f\u56e2\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells.

The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fr\u00e9chet-type distribution with a $\\sim50$-year return period in $1\u03c3$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\u03be< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A.

These stars influence their surroundings through strong winds which are highly structured processes. The theoretical study of the non-symmetric phenomena of the stellar winds are becoming important these days, mainly because 1-D models are not sufficient enough.\n  We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model.\n  The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path.\n  We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes.

Our goal is to identify planet candidates that are below the detection threshold set by the SPOC and QLP pipelines using sherlock, a specialized pipeline for robust detection and vetting of transit signals in TESS data. We present the discovery of two inner rocky planets in the TOI-237 and TOI-4336 A systems, confirmed with ground-based photometry from the TRAPPIST, SPECULOOS, ExTrA, and LCO facilities. TOI-237 c has a radius of 1.21 +/- 0.04Re, orbits its mid-M host star every 1.74 days, and is close to a 3:1 mean-motion resonance with TOI-237 b. TOI-4336 A c has a radius of 1.17 +/- 0.06Re, and orbits with a period of 7.58 days an M3.5 host star which is part of a hierarchical triple system. We performed model comparison to search for non-zero eccentricities, and found that the circular transit models are statistically favored. Dynamical simulations show that both systems are in stable configurations, and the TTVs expected for the TOI-237 system are of the order of seconds. TOI-237 c and TOI-4336 A c join the high-interest population of warm likely super-Earths below the so-called \"radius valley\". In particular, TOI-237 c is a good candidate for phase curve observations with JWST/MIRI thanks to the small radius of the host star and its short period.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7TESS\u6570\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u989d\u5916\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u9897\u5185\u90e8\u5ca9\u77f3\u884c\u661fTOI-237 c\u548cTOI-4336 A c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u786e\u8ba4\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8bc6\u522bSPOC\u548cQLP\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b9c\u5c45\u884c\u661f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528sherlock\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8eTESS\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u548c\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982TRAPPIST\u3001SPECULOOS\u3001ExTrA\u548cLCO\uff09\u786e\u8ba4\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u9897\u5ca9\u77f3\u884c\u661fTOI-237 c\uff08\u534a\u5f841.21 \u00b1 0.04Re\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f1.74\u5929\uff09\u548cTOI-4336 A c\uff08\u534a\u5f841.17 \u00b1 0.06Re\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f7.58\u5929\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u9897\u884c\u661f\u5747\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "TOI-237 c\u548cTOI-4336 A c\u662f\u4f4d\u4e8e\"\u534a\u5f84\u8c37\"\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fTOI-237 c\u9002\u5408JWST/MIRI\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Our W-CDFS image has an angular resolution of 15 arcsec and a 1$\u03c3$ RMS in Stokes $I$ of $\\approx$50 $\u03bc$Jy/beam. We detect 1920 distinct source components in Stokes $I$ and 175 in linear polarization. We examine the polarized source counts, Faraday Rotation measures, and fractional polarization of the sources in the survey. We show that sources with a total intensity above $\\approx$10mJy have a mean fractional polarization value of $\\approx$3% from modeling the polarized counts. We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population. In addition to characterizing the S-band polarization properties of sources in the W-CDFS, this study will be used to validate the shallower, but higher angular resolution S-band polarimetric information that the VLA Sky Survey will provide for the whole sky above Declination -40 degrees over the next few years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86W-CDFS\u4e2dS\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff082-4 GHz\uff09\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u52301920\u4e2aStokes I\u6e90\u548c175\u4e2a\u504f\u632f\u6e90\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u6e90\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u7ea63%\uff0c\u5f31\u6e90\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\u22643%\uff0c\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790W-CDFS\u4e2d\u5c04\u6e90\u7684S\u6ce2\u6bb5\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5373\u5c06\u5f00\u5c55\u7684VLA\u5168\u5929\u504f\u632f\u5de1\u5929\uff08S\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528S\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff082-4 GHz\uff09\u89c2\u6d4bW-CDFS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Stokes I\u548c\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6e90\u5e76\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u53ca\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5bf9\u5f31\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u53e0\u52a0\u6cd5\u4f30\u7b97\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u6e90\uff08\u226510mJy\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u7ea63%\uff0c\u5f31\u6e90\uff08<1mJy\uff09\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\u22643%\uff1b\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u5e73\u8c31\u6e90\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u8f83\u4f4e\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "W-CDFS\u7684S\u6ce2\u6bb5\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\u4e3aVLA\u5168\u5929\u5de1\u5929\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ca\u5f31\u6e90\u7684\u504f\u632f\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Saridakis"], "title": "A null test of the Hubble tension", "comment": "5 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "The origin of the Hubble tension remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology, with competing explanations invoking either early-Universe physics, late-time modifications of cosmic expansion, or unresolved observational systematics. In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u96f6\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6807\u51c6\u8b66\u62a5\u5149\u5ea6\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u6807\u51c6\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u533a\u5206\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6216\u665a\u671f\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7269\u7406\u3001\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6807\u51c6\u8b66\u62a5\u5149\u5ea6\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u7ea2\u79fb\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u6bd4\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u9636\u68af\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6216\u665a\u671f\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u900f\u955c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6807\u51c6\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u4e3a\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u8fd9\u4e00\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

For each spectrum, we perform a spectral decomposition to isolate the broad H$\u03b2$ emission. We measure the luminosity, FWHM, equivalent width, centroid, and Pearson skewness coefficient of broad H$\u03b2$ and provide derived physical properties such as the single-epoch black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity. For each pair of spectra in the sample, we calculate the change in radial velocity of the centroid of broad H$\u03b2$ emission ($\u0394v_{rad}$) as well as other derived properties related to broad H$\u03b2$ shape variability. We use forward-modeling methods to estimate the uncertainty in our measurements and discuss an improved method for estimating the uncertainty in $\u0394v_{rad}$ in the case where a spectral decomposition is used to isolate the broad H$\u03b2$ emission. We find that $\u0394v_{rad}$ is not normally distributed and that the shape of the distribution depends on the interval between observations.

This study re-analyzes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of Kamo`oalewa published by B. N. L. Sharkey et al. (2021), obtained using the Large Binocular Telescope, to infer its mineral composition and space weathering characteristics. Spectral similarity analysis is performed by comparing the spectrum of Kamo`oalewa to the mean spectra of various types in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy to make a preliminary constraint on the combined characteristics of surface mineralogy and space weathering effects. To further characterize the mineral composition, a detailed analysis of the 1 \u03bcm band center is conducted based on spectral data below 1.25 \u03bcm that have higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical models for normalized spectra are developed to estimate the Is/FeO content. The results suggest that asteroid Kamo`oalewa has higher olivine abundance than that of typical S-type asteroids and the Moon, exhibiting an immature to submature degree of space weathering.

We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity.

Post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS using the JWST/MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer were obtained on 2025 December 15--16 and 27 when the object was at heliocentric distances of 2.20 and 2.54 au, respectively. Our 5--28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $\u03bd_2$ band of water at 5.8--7.0 microns. the primary $\u03bd_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma.

Hillier"], "title": "Mixing-induced thermal instabilities and coronal condensations", "comment": "submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u4e0e\u70ed\u7269\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u8f90\u5c04MHD\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u526a\u5207\u9a71\u52a8\u7684KHI\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u788e\u88c2\u548c\u70ed\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u70ed\u7269\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e2d\u95f4\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u8f90\u5c04\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\uff08MHD\uff09\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u526a\u5207\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Kelvin-Helmholtz\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08KHI\uff09\u5728\u51b7\u51dd\u7ed3\u7269\u4e0e\u70ed\u65e5\u5195\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u5f62\u6210\u5e76\u62c9\u4f38\u6210\u5782\u76f4\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u7a84\u957f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u788e\u88c2\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u56e2\u5757\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\uff1b\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d21\u732e\u4e8615-20%\u7684\u603b\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u5145\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u7684\u51b7\u7269\u8d28\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08sIMF\uff09\u662f\u7531\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u539f\u7406\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u51b7\u5374\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5c06sIMF\u89c6\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u4e0e\u661f\u56e2\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u652f\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6b63\u5f0f\u786e\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u539f\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u56e2\u5757\u7684\u788e\u88c2\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7531\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u51b7\u5374\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u71b5\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fasIMF\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u504f\u79bbsIMF\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u90fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86sIMF\u662f\u7531\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u539f\u7406\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660esIMF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u65e0\u504f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Gaia XP\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u5927\u6837\u672c\u70ed\u4e9a\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7269\u7406\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u661f\u7387\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u4e9a\u77ee\u661f\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u7d2b\u5916\u8d85\u989d\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\u5176Gaia XP\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u7269\u7406\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Gaia XP\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u732e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ea620000\u9897\u5019\u9009\u70ed\u4e9a\u77ee\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5229\u7528UMAP\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SOMs\u548cCNNs\u5206\u7c7b\u5149\u8c31\uff08\u5355/\u53cc\u661f\u3001\u51b7\u8d2b\u6c26/\u70ed\u5bcc\u6c26\uff09\u3002\u5149\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u57fa\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "BP-RP\u989c\u8272\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6c26\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e5f\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u53cc\u661f\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e24\u6761\u7ea4\u7ef4\u72b6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u53cc\u661f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc760%\u3002CNN\u663e\u793a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "Gaia XP\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u4e9a\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53cc\u661f\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5bc6\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u548c\u6fc0\u53d8\u53d8\u661f\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u3002"}}

Chemical evolution model of the Nuclear Stellar Disc in a Bayesian framework", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics (A&A). The manuscript includes 13 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) of the Milky Way is a dense, rotating stellar system in the central 200 pc. The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$\u03b1$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates.

Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u6ce2\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u6df7\u5408\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u963b\u5c3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u80fd\u5b9a\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u6ce2\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u963b\u5c3c\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u53c2\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u963b\u5c3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e5f\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u9650\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u7684\u9884\u671f\u503c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6709\u9650\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u4e0b\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u9650\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $<150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $< 100$ m\\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\u0393\\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt\u03b3$ with $\u03b3\\equiv G/G_{\\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\u0393=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\u03c3$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\u03b3=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1<v_{\\rm obs}/v_{\\rm escN}\\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND).

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "The evolutionary origin of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars at Solar metallicity is unclear. Single-star evolution from massive O stars, possibly via a Luminous Blue Variable phase, is challenged by binary period distributions of different WR subtypes. Wd1-72 is a WN7b+O binary embedded in the collective wind of the Galactic young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). It is surrounded by highly structured nebulosity, with cometary tails pointing away from Wd 1 and quasi-spherical droplets towards it. In this letter, we demonstrate that this morphology can be qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic simulation of non-conservative Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) mass-loss into a cluster wind. Our model is based on a detailed binary evolution track consistent with key known properties of Wd1-72. Our work suggests Wd1-72 could be only ~10 kyr post-RLOF, and the hydrogen-free nature of Wd1-72 favours this being a second or subsequent RLOF episode. Follow-up observations could make Wd1-72 a valuable benchmark for probing mass-loss and mass-transfer in forming gravitational-wave binary-progenitor systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86WR\u6052\u661f\u5728\u592a\u9633\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88RLOF\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u5230\u661f\u56e2\u98ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Wd1-72\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "WR\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5355\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u5468\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88RLOF\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u5230\u661f\u56e2\u98ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u4e86Wd1-72\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7ea61\u4e07\u5e74\u524d\u7684RLOF\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u4e14\u6c22\u7f3a\u5931\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b21RLOF\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "Wd1-72\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u53cc\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7GIZMO\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u671f\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u4e0e\u6655\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08RC\uff09\u4e0b\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GIZMO\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684GSE\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6655\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u4e0e\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u5e45\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0\"\u8df7\u8df7\u677f\"\u5f0f\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u957f\u671f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6469\u64e6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u8005\u540c\u65f6\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u9ad8\u503e\u89d2\u5408\u5e76\u53ef\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u671f\u987a\u884c\u8fdb\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u9a71\u52a8\u76d8\u7fd8\u66f2\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \\approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\\gtrsim 17.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528LSST\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53ca\u5149\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "AGN\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u7406\u3001\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u9ed1\u6d1e\u751f\u957f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u5747\u4e00\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408ZTF\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\u4e86AGN\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LSST\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u94bb\u63a2\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "ZTF\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u5149\u53d8\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5438\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5149\u5b66\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u5e38\u8d85\u51fa\u8584\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002LSST\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u4e2d\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LSST\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u533a\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4e2d\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8AGN\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u3001\u5bbd\u7ebf\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u751f\u957f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Submitted", "summary": "One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z>10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$\u03b1$ or [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfbCEERS2-588\uff08$z=11.04$\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u661f\u66b4\u3002", "motivation": "JWST\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cf$z>10$\u7684\u660e\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u7ea6\u675f\u5176\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9CEERS2-588\u8fdb\u884cJWST/MIRI\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176SED\u548c\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728$z>10$\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5df4\u5c14\u672b\u8df3\u53d8\u3002", "result": "CEERS2-588\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u8fbe$10^{9.1}M_\\\\\\odot$\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u592a\u9633\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3$z>15$\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u6548\u661f\u66b4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u660e\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Our imaging targets two fields at a projected distance of 50 kpc from the galaxy's center, with a 50% photometric completeness limit of F814W = 28.0, nearly two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch. In both fields we find a clear detection of red giant stars in M96's halo, with a space density that corresponds to an equivalent broadband surface brightness of $\u03bc_V \\approx $ 31.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find little evidence for any difference in the spatial density or color of the RGB stars in the two fields. Using isochrone matching we derive a median metallicity for the red giants of [M/H] = -1.36 with an interquartile spread of $\\pm$0.75 dex. Adopting a power-law radial density profile, we also derive a total halo mass of $M_h = 7.8^{+17.4}_{-4.9}\\times10^9$ M$_\\odot$, implying a stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{*,halo}/M_{*,tot} = 15^{+33}_{-9}$%, on the high end for spiral galaxies, but with significant uncertainty. Finally, we find that M96 appears offset from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relationship for spirals, with a halo that is distinctly metal-poor for its halo mass. While a variety of systematic effects could have conspired to drive M96 off this relationship, if confirmed our results may argue for a markedly different accretion history for M96 compared to other spirals in the nearby universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u87ba\u65cb\u661f\u7cfbM96\u5916\u6655\u4e2d\u7684\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf-\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660eM96\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u87ba\u65cb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76M96\u661f\u7cfb\u5916\u6655\u7684\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\u5728\u87ba\u65cb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u54c8\u52c3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5bf9M96\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc350 kpc\u5916\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u652f\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u548c\u7b49\u9f84\u7ebf\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6790\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u989c\u8272\u53ca\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u533a\u57df\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\uff0c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e2d\u503c\u4e3a[M/H] = -1.36\uff0c\u6655\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a7.8\u00d710^9 M\u2609\uff0c\u4e14M96\u504f\u79bb\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf-\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "M96\u7684\u6655\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u87ba\u65cb\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

This approach enables reliable recovery of \\Lya\\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \\Lya\\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \\Lya\\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission.
