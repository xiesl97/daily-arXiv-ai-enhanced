That survey can still be mined to extract a wealth of data. We derive new abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti for 948, 954, 1542, and 1350 red giant branch stars in 16 GCs, both formed in situ or accreted in the Milky Way. The program GCs cover the metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-2.35 dex to [Fe/H]=-0.74 dex. Both the halo and disc GCs show a clear overabundance of alpha-elements with the modulation in Mg and Si due to the MPs phenomenon in different clusters. We found star to star variations in Si abundance correlated to changes in Na in more than half of our sample, implying that temperatures in excess of about 65 MK were achieved in the polluters responsible for the enrichment. We confirm with an enlarged sample the previous result that significant variations in Mg are observed in GCs that are metal-poor, massive or both. Evidence of excess of Ca with respect to reference unpolluted field stars are found in NGC 6752 and NGC 7078, indicating the action of proton-capture reactions at very high temperature regime in these GCs. These excesses fit very well in a previously found relation as a function of a combination of cluster mass and metallicity shown by other typical signatures of MPs. At odds with previous results based on the Si abundance from APOGEE, we found that the average abundance of alpha-elements is not an efficient discriminating factor between in situ and accreted GCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAMES\u8c03\u67e5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\uff08GCs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u661f\u65cf\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86Mg\u3001Si\u3001Ca\u548cTi\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Si\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0eNa\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caMg\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u7684GCs\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cCa\u7684\u8fc7\u5269\u73b0\u8c61\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8d28\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u53cd\u5e94\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7FLAMES\u8c03\u67e5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6316\u6398\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u591a\u91cd\u661f\u65cf\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fMg\u3001Si\u3001Ca\u548cTi\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684948\u81f31542\u9897\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u5206\u652f\u6052\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86Mg\u3001Si\u3001Ca\u548cTi\u7684\u65b0\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece[Fe/H]=-2.35\u5230[Fe/H]=-0.74\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Si\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0eNa\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0cMg\u4e30\u5ea6\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u7684GCs\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u660e\u663e\u3002Ca\u7684\u8fc7\u5269\u73b0\u8c61\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u03b1\u5143\u7d20\u5e73\u5747\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0d\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u539f\u4f4d\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u7684GCs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u661f\u65cf\u7684\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14Mg\u3001Si\u548cCa\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0eGCs\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002Si\u4e0eNa\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6838\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u51cf\u5c11\u3002HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u8fd8\u4e0e\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5df2\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08IMF\uff09\u3002HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u03b1\u5143\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u95f4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752827\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5747\u5300\u03b1\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u5728\u9ad8\u3001\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u652f\u6301IMF\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HEx\u6bd4\u7387\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0cIMF\u5728\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u5c11\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u3002\u6b64\u524dAPOGEE\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5224M 54\u661f\u56e2\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

This survey targeted 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc to search for mid-infrared excesses, flux deficits from collision-induced absorption, and resolved substellar companions. In this paper we present our analysis of WD 0644+025, an unusually massive white dwarf (0.95 Msun) and the MEAD target exhibiting the most significant mid-infrared excess. The observed JWST MIRI photometry shows a 7.3 sigma excess at 15 microns and a 3.6 sigma excess at 10 microns, which may be associated with either a planetary companion or a circumstellar dust disk. This excess corresponds to a companion mass of 6.8 Mjup (Teff=261 +/- 9 K) with orbital distance <11.8 au, although substantially lower masses are possible if we consider a closely orbiting insolated companion. No spatially resolved sources are detected within 200 au, with contrast curve analysis excluding planets more massive than 2 Mjup beyond ~12 au. Metal pollution is confirmed in both archival Keck HIRES spectra from 1999 and new observations from 2025, with no evidence suggesting the accretion rate has substantially changed over the decades. We explore possible dust disk morphologies to describe the observed IR excess, and find that traditional debris disks struggle to fit our data.

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen ($\\textrm{H}\\textsc{i}$) enables volumetric intensity mapping of large-scale structure in the post-reionization Universe. In anticipation of \\texttt{SKA-MID}'s wide redshift coverage and high signal-to-noise clustering measurements, we study the redshift-space 21-cm bispectrum and its spherical-harmonic multipoles as probes of anisotropic non-linear structure formation and departures from General Relativity. Using a tree-level perturbative description for the 21-cm brightness-temperature field in redshift space, and adopting the Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ model as a representative modified-gravity scenario, we forecast the detectability of configuration-dependent signatures with an \\texttt{SKA-MID}--like survey. We derive the bispectrum-multipole covariance including sample variance and thermal noise and evaluate the expected signal-to-noise of deviations relative to $\u039b$CDM. We find that the observable information is dominated by the lowest multipoles, while higher-order modes are strongly suppressed. This concentration in the lowest multipoles is well matched to \\texttt{SKA-MID} sensitivity and to the quasi-linear modes that are expected to remain accessible in practice. The strongest modified-gravity sensitivity arises from squeezed and stretched triangle configurations on quasi-linear scales, where scale-dependent growth enhances the bispectrum relative to the total variance.

These assumptions have not been systematically tested. We assessed the accuracy of standard treatments of average polarisation profiles in M dwarfs and their interpretation with ZDI. We focused on the filling-factor approach, which attempts to represent coexisting global and small-scale fields. We performed polarised radiative transfer calculations across the near-infrared spectrum of a typical M dwarf. From these theoretical spectra, we derived mean Stokes profiles and approximated them with different line-synthesis methods. To test the recovery of global fields, we performed ZDI inversions using simulated Stokes V observations for low- and high-activity cases. The analytical approximation of mean polarisation profiles reproduces Stokes I and V only for fields up to ~1 kG and fails for linear polarisation. ZDI with single-line analytical Stokes V profiles is adequate for weakly magnetic M dwarfs with fields below a few hundred gauss. However, combined with the filling-factor formalism, this traditional modelling approach produces unphysical local fields and distorted global geometries for active M dwarfs with multi-kilogauss fields. These issues are mitigated using a new mapping technique based on theoretical Stokes profiles that account for both global and randomly distributed small-scale fields. Our study reveals fundamental limitations of current ZDI analyses of active M dwarfs and questions the reliability of some published maps.

We recover the previously-detected rise in occurrence with semimajor axis for both lower- and higher-mass subsets of the population out to $\\sim$5 au. When restricting to planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 4.5 au (roughly speaking, the \"peak\" of giant planet occurrence), we find evidence for distinct eccentricity distributions for each of two mass sub-populations. Most strikingly, we observe a peak in the eccentricity distribution of super-Jovian planets (3-20~M$_{\\rm J}$) at 0.3, which is apparent using two different parameterizations of the eccentricity distribution model. A hierarchical histogram model reveals that $\\sim$92% of posterior samples indicate an elevated occurrence rate of super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities (0.2-0.4) compared to lower or higher eccentricities (i.e. evidence for a moderate eccentricity \"peak\"), and 99% of samples indicate super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities are more common than those with lower eccentricities (i.e. evidence that moderate eccentricities are more common than low eccentricities). We use a truncated Gaussian model fit to pinpoint the location of the super-Jupiter eccentricity peak with more precision, finding a maximum a posterior (MAP) peak location of $e=0.3$. This low but elevated characteristic eccentricity could be the result of dynamically hot histories, perhaps involving a giant impacts phase.

Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.\n  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.\n  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u767d\u76ae\u4e66\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa2040\u5e74\u4ee3\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u89c2\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5747\u5300\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u884c\u661f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5927\u6c14\uff09\u672a\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5c45\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672a\u6765\u4efb\u52a1\u867d\u5c06\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u79d1\u5b66\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5747\u5300\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u4e3a2040\u5e74\u4ee3\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u610f\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5168\u9762\u63ed\u793a\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u767d\u76ae\u4e66\u547c\u54012040\u5e74\u4ee3\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u89c2\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u661f\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u884c\u661f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Bars redistribute angular momentum across the galaxy, regulating star formation, AGN activity, and building new stellar structures such as nuclear discs. However, the effects of bar-driven evolution on young galaxies are not yet known, as no evidence of bar-built stellar structures has ever been found beyond $z = 1$, until now. In this work, we show evidence of a bar-built, star-forming nuclear disc, already present at redshift $z = 1.5$. This is the first evidence of a bar-built stellar structure at Cosmic Noon. We find that this nuclear disc is actively forming stars and has the same size as some nuclear discs in nearby galaxies. This evidence solidifies the now emerging picture in which bars are fundamental not only in the late evolution of galaxies, but also in their early evolutionary stages. It changes the current paradigm by urging a revision of our picture of galaxy evolution beyond redshift one, to include new considerations on the role played by bars as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u5e74\u5df2\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5e74\u8f7b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u7ea2\u79fb1.5\u5904\u53d1\u73b0\u7531\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u661f\u66b4\u6838\u76d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7ea2\u79fb1\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7ea2\u79fb1.5\u5904\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u661f\u66b4\u6838\u76d8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6838\u76d8\uff0c\u5176\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u76d8\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u661f\u7cfb\u68d2\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\uff08\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u5e74\uff09\u5373\u5f00\u59cb\u5f71\u54cd\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

The novel feature of our investigation is an iterative solution for the non-linear equation for the scalar field $\u03c7= \u03a6- \u03a8$, where $\u03a6$ and $\u03a8$ are the potentials that characterise scalar perturbations of the metric. We demonstrate the scheme on spherical perturbations - smooth, compensated top-hats of varying length scales. We find that the effect of the Chameleon mechanism is seen most prominently on scales where the size of the top-hat is comparable to the Compton scale of the background. There is a density enhancement near the outer edge of the top-hat and the top-hat does not retain its shape. We explain this well-known observation in the context of the spatio-temporal evolution of the Compton scale. Additionally, we find a slight enhancement of the density near the origin, a feature not reported previously in the literature. On scales much smaller or much larger than the background Compton length, including the Chameleon screening has no appreciable effect on the perturbations. In the former, the growth is enhanced as compared to GR and is almost the same as GR in the latter. Finally, we examine the non-linear density velocity divergence (DVDR) relation and find that for evolution affected by Chameleon screening, the DVDR is no longer one-to-one even for a single profile. The relation between density and velocity depends on the location within the perturbation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86$f(R)$\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dChameleon\u5c4f\u853d\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7269\u8d28\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7403\u5f62\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22Chameleon\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7269\u8d28\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6807\u91cf\u573a$\u03c7=\u03a6\u2212\u03a8$\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7403\u5f62\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8865\u507f\u9876\u5e3d\uff09\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "Chameleon\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u8fd1\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9876\u5e3d\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6539\u53d8\uff1b\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u5728\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u6216\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0cChameleon\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bc6\u5ea6-\u901f\u5ea6\u6563\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff08DVDR\uff09\u4e5f\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "Chameleon\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548cDVDR\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3$f(R)$\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Aims: We aim to understand the origins of the Necklace and its dwarf carbon central star. Methods: We study the carbon abundance of the nebula through far ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Furthermore, through simultaneous modelling of multiband light and velocity curves, we attempt to constrain the parameters of the central star system. Results: Puzzlingly, we find that the region of the inner nebula observed with the Hubble Space Telescope is seemingly not carbon-rich, at odds with the dwarf carbon star nature of the companion of the central star. The initial mass of the nebular progenitor was likely very close to the limit to become carbon-rich, perhaps experiencing a very late thermal pulse. The dwarf carbon star companion is found to be significantly inflated with respect to that expected for an isolated main sequence star of the same mass. Conclusions: The properties of the central binary are consistent with the progenitor having become carbon-rich and its companion having accreted a significant amount of that carbon-enriched material. However, it is unclear how this evolutionary hypothesis can be reconciled with the inner nebula potentially being carbon poor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Necklace\u661f\u4e91\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f34\u661f\u662f\u78b3\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u661f\u4e91\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u975e\u78b3\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u661f\u7684\u78b3\u77ee\u661f\u6027\u8d28\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u7279\u6027\u652f\u6301\u661f\u4e91\u524d\u8eab\u78b3\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e14\u4f34\u661f\u5438\u79ef\u78b3\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u661f\u4e91\u5185\u90e8\u78b3\u8d2b\u4e4f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Necklace\u661f\u4e91\u53ca\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u78b3\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u8fdc\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u661f\u4e91\u7684\u78b3\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5149\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7ea6\u675f\u6838\u5fc3\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u661f\u4e91\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u975e\u78b3\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u78b3\u77ee\u661f\u6027\u8d28\u77db\u76fe\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u53cc\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u652f\u6301\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u78b3\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e14\u4f34\u661f\u5438\u79ef\u78b3\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u661f\u4e91\u5185\u90e8\u78b3\u8d2b\u4e4f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6838\u5fc3\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u78b3\u5bcc\u96c6\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u661f\u4e91\u5185\u90e8\u78b3\u8d2b\u4e4f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We report detections of CS $J=6-5$, N$_2$H$^+$ $J=3-2$, C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$, H$_2$CS $J_{K_a, K_c} = 8_{1,7}-7_{1,6}$, H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$, and H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{2,3}-3_{2,2}$, as well as a tentative detection of $^{13}$C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$. We observe azimuthal asymmetry in CS and H$_2$CS emission, as well as radially structured H$_2$CO $4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ emission outside the dust continuum. C$^{18}$O and H$_2$CO 4$_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ show significant cloud contamination, while CS and N$_2$H$^+$ are good tracers of Keplerian rotation originating from the disk. Envelope emission does not appear to contribute significantly either to the continuum or molecular line observations. GY 91's chemical properties appear in large part to resemble those of Class II disks, although observations of additional molecular probes should be obtained for a fuller comparison. With CS, we estimated a dynamical stellar mass of 0.58 $M_\\odot$, which is higher than previous estimates from stellar evolutionary models (0.25 $M_\\odot$). Using both radiative transfer modeling of the dust continuum and comparison of the C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes to literature thermochemical models, we estimate a disk mass of $\\sim0.01$ $M_\\odot$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7ALMA\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e74\u8f7b\u6052\u661f\u5929\u4f53GY 91\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u8c31\u7ebf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CS\u548cH\u2082CS\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53caH\u2082CO\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f84\u5411\u53d1\u5c04\u3002\u5176\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7c7b\u4f3cII\u7c7b\u76d8\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GY 91\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u65e9\u671f\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u76d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528ALMA 12-m\u548cACA\u9635\u5217\u7684Band 7\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u8c31\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u9012\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u70ed\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CS\u548cN\u2082H\u207a\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d8Keplerian\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u826f\u597d\u793a\u8e2a\u7269\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff080.58 M\u2609\uff09\u548c\u76d8\u8d28\u91cf\uff08~0.01 M\u2609\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GY 91\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u63a5\u8fd1II\u7c7b\u76d8\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u5b50\u63a2\u9488\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5584\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

Due to the low dark rate and read-noise free nature of MAMA detectors, observations of UV-dim sources can result in exposures with 0 or 1 counts in some pixels. In this regime, the \"root-N\" approximation widely used to calculate uncertainties breaks down, and one must compute Poisson confidence intervals for more accurate uncertainty calculations. The CalCOS pipeline was updated in 2020 to account for these low-count uncertainties. Here, we assess how STIS observations are currently affected by this phenomenon, describe a new Jupyter notebook exploring the issue, and introduce a new utility, stistools.poisson_err, to manually calculate Poisson confidence intervals for 1D STIS spectra.

These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. We present a new data-driven method for empirically measuring the circular velocity curve of the Galaxy that uses element abundance gradients in the plane of radial kinematics. We use stellar surface abundances from the $\\textit{APOGEE}$ survey combined with kinematic data from the $\\textit{Gaia}$ mission. Our results confirm the ordered structure of the Milky Way disk in terms of average [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios, and suggest that $\\langle$[Fe/H]$\\rangle$ traces the radial position of stars in the disk, while $\\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\\rangle$ traces the orbital excursions around this radius. Our method uses the radial orbit structure in the Galaxy to enable an empirical measurement of the circular velocity curve, epicyclic and azimuthal frequencies, and kinematic gradients across the Milky Way disk. From these measurements, we infer a value of the circular velocity curve at the Solar radius of $v_{c,\\odot} = 235.3^{+2.8}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. We also measure the radial and azimuthal frequencies for a circular orbit at the solar radius, $\u03ba_{0,R_\\odot}=36.9^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $\u03a9_{0,R_\\odot}=28.5_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. These values lead to an estimate of the Oort constants of $A = 16.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $B=-11.9^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.

By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses.

Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as switchbacks, rather than plasma inhomogeneities along the beam path. Using simulations and remote observations of 24 interplanetary type III bursts observed by Parker Solar Probe, we relate measured drift-rate variations to local field deflections. In 50% of events, we identify disturbances above a $2\u03c3$ noise level that can be attributed to perpendicular deflections of the field between (0.7-1.7) R$_\\odot$, over scales (1.8-6.4) R$_\\odot$ at heliocentric distances (9-30) R$_\\odot$. The features correspond to either density changes of (10-30)%, or deflections of the field direction by (23-88)$^\\circ$. Further, beam transport simulations show field direction perturbations produce additional observational signatures in type III bursts: delayed emission, intensity breaks, and enhanced emission resembling stria fine structures. In addition, we identified four bursts where the observed variations are more plausibly explained by field deflections, possibly in the form of magnetic switchbacks, than by unrealistically large density changes along the field line. The results show that variations in type III burst profiles can arise from magnetic as well as density fluctuations, and demonstrate the value of type III bursts as remote probes of inner-heliospheric structure at kilometric wavelengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "Type III solar radio bursts' drift-rate variations are analyzed, suggesting disturbances in magnetic fields, like switchbacks, rather than plasma density changes, explain observations.

It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u4e9a\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u4fa3\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u6001\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff09\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u5c11\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u8fd8\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u4e9a\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MESA\u548cSSE\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6052\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u53ca\u5176\u4e9a\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u4f34\u6709\u4e9a\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\uff080.53-0.66 Msun\uff09\u548c\u8f83\u5e74\u8f7b\uff081-6 Gyr\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u7ea695%\u7684\u4f34\u4fa3\u4e3a\u6c14\u6001\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6839\u636e\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u4f34\u6709\u4e9a\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9650\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u53d7\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u5173\u7cfb\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched.

We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($\u03c3$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $\u03c3$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\\sim$2 and $\\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $\u03c3$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z>3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $\u03c3$ and $v/\u03c3$ as well as the dependence of $\u03c3$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling.

The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \\texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $\u03a9_\\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ of the order 10.

We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St<=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St<=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u626d\u77e9\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u56fa\u4f53\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u4f53\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u503c\uff08\u03b5=0.01\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5ffd\u7565\u56fa\u4f53\u6210\u5206\u7684\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u626d\u77e9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff08\u03b5=0.03\u548c\u03b5=0.1\uff09\u5bf9\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u626d\u77e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u56fa\u4f53\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u5b8c\u5168\u8026\u5408\u7684\u65e0\u538b\u6d41\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u3002\u884c\u661f\u88ab\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u9759\u6001\u626d\u77e9\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u5305\u62ec\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u6570\uff080.01\u81f310\uff09\u3001\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u659c\u7387\uff08p=0.5\u30011.0\u30011.5\uff09\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u6548\u7387\uff08\u03b7=0%\u300110%\u3001100%\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u03b5=0.01\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u626d\u77e9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u56fa\u4f53\u626d\u77e9\u968f\u03b5\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6c14\u4f53\u626d\u77e9\u5728\u03b5=0.1\u65f6\u504f\u5dee50-100%\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5bf9St\u22641\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53d1\u751f\u7b26\u53f7\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u5171\u540c\u8f68\u9053\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6c14\u4f53\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u884c\u661f\u5feb\u901f\u5438\u79ef\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fa\u4f53\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u626d\u77e9\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8eSt\u22642\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u76d8\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u8f68\u8ff9\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u8026\u5408\u56fa\u4f53\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u662f\u5851\u9020\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e9\u671f\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Gaia\u536b\u661fCCD\u56e0\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u4f24\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CtiPixel\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Gaia\u536b\u661f\u7684CCD\u5728L2\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u80fd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u592a\u9633\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6c38\u4e45\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6052\u661f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901a\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578bCtiPixel\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6bcf3-4\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e32\u884c\u65b9\u5411CCD\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684CTI\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f90\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684CCD\u7f3a\u9677\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u4e32\u884cCTI\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u5c0f\u5e45\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u548c\u5de5\u7a0bCCD\u9000\u706b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "CtiPixel\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86Gaia CCD\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86CCD\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Heavens", "Arthur Loureiro"], "title": "Almanac: HMC sampling with bounded velocity", "comment": null, "summary": "In Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, the shape of the potential and the choice of the momentum distribution jointly give rise to the Hamiltonian dynamics of the sampler. An efficient sampler propagates quickly in all regions of the parameter space, so that the chain has a low autocorrelation length and the sampler has a high acceptance rate, with the goal of optimising the number of near-independent samples for given computational cost. Standard Gaussian momentum distributions allow arbitrarily large velocities, which can lead to inefficient exploration in posteriors with ridges or funnel-like geometries. We investigate alternative momentum distributions based on relativistic and Student's t kinetic energies, which naturally limit particle velocities and may improve robustness. Using Almanac, a sampler for cosmological posterior distributions of sky maps and power spectra on the sphere, we test these alternatives in both low- and high-dimensional settings. We find that the choice of parameterization and momentum distribution can improve convergence and effective sample rate, though the achievable gains are generally modest and strongly problem-dependent, reaching up to an order of magnitude in favorable cases. Among the momentum distributions that we tested, those with moderately heavy tails achieved the best balance between efficiency and stability.

While there have been claims of the existence of at least one more significant merger before this time, supporting evidence has been indirect and contentious. Here we show that the population of globular clusters around the Galaxy depicts three distinct age-metallicity sequences, one associated with the merger with Gaia-Enceladus 10 billion years ago, one to the progenitor of the Milky Way and a third intermediate sequence associated to at least one merger which we estimate took place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. This discovery has been possible thanks to exquisite Hubble Space Telescope data and sophisticated analysis that enables very precise relative age determination of globular clusters. The newly identified sequence reveals that this merger took place with an object of stellar mass similar to that of Gaia-Enceladus (~5x10$^8$ M$_{\\odot}$), and which deposited most of its mass in the inner 6 kpc of the Milky Way.

Salvati"], "title": "A thin disk and a nearly universal accretion rate in luminous quasars", "comment": "9 Pages, 8 Figures. Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics. Comments are very welcome", "summary": "Quasars accretion models predict a broad range of optical and ultraviolet properties that depend primarily on black hole mass and accretion rate. Yet, most optically selected luminous quasars display strikingly similar continuum spectra. We show that this uniformity can be explained by a nearly constant luminosity to mass (Eddington) ratio, L_EDD and by thermal emission from a standard, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc. A standard disk with an Eddington ratio L_EDD=0.1 reproduces both the black hole mass/luminosity distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars and their principal continuum properties. In this framework, the spectral energy distribution peaks beyond the observable ultraviolet range for nearly all sources. We show that the few quasars, expected to be cold enough to shift the peak into the observable region, indeed show this behaviour. This scenario is further supported by an analysis of the relation between the luminosity of the main broad emission lines and the continuum luminosity (i.e. the Baldwin effect). We find that 1) the observed slopes of the line to continuum relations match the expectations from the standard disk model, if we assume that the line emission is a good proxy of the ionizing luminosity; 2) the dispersions of the line-continuum luminosity relations are very small (as small as 0.13 dex), suggesting that the physics of the disk-broad line region system is dominated by only one parameter (the black hole mass) with a nearly constant Eddington ratio. Finally, we notice that our hypothesis of constant L_EDD=0.1 provides a black hole mass estimate (based on the observed luminosity) with a smaller error than the virial estimate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u7387\uff08L_EDD=0.1\uff09\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8584\u76d8\u70ed\u53d1\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86SDSS\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf/\u5149\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u6b8a\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u53caBaldwin\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5149\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u660e\u4eae\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u9891\u8c31\u4e3a\u4f55\u5982\u6b64\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u8584\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u7387\uff08L_EDD=0.1\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Baldwin\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09SDSS\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u8d28\u91cf/\u5149\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8584\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b2\uff09\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5cf0\u503c\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09Baldwin\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u659c\u7387\u548c\u5c0f\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u7387\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u7387\uff08L_EDD=0.1\uff09\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8584\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The diameter of 2025 FA22 is estimated between 130 and 290 meters. It is among the largest NEAs observable at such proximity, prompting an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) rapidresponse campaign. Although early orbital solutions indicated a possible impact in 2089, further follow-up astrometric observations ruled out collision hazard. The favourable geometry of this close encounter enabled a dense coverage of the positive part of the phasepolarisation curve, from the high polarisation domain (high phase angles), nearly to the inversion angle where the linear polarisation rate vanishes. The spectropolarimetric observations provided the wavelength dependence of the polarisation rate. Using empirical relationships, an estimate of the geometric albedo could be drawn from the slope of the phase-polarisation curve at inversion angle. Moreover, the spectropolarimetric trends yielded constraints on the taxonomic class. These results demonstrate the interest of polarimetry and spectropolarimetry for rapid characterisation of newly discovered NEAs in planetary defence campaigns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd1\u5730\u5c0f\u884c\u661f2025 FA22\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u8868\u5f81\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8fd1\u5730\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u9632\u5fa1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u632f\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u6392\u9664\u4e862025 FA22\u57282089\u5e74\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u4e86\u5176\u76f4\u5f84\u548c\u53cd\u7167\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65b0\u8fd1\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u884c\u661f\u9632\u5fa1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band.

We find that accreted stellar halos are typically built by only a few progenitors and are highly sensitive to the fate of the most massive satellite, producing order-of-magnitude variations in accreted stellar halo mass even at fixed host halo mass. Different stellar components trace distinct phases of host halo growth: central and accreted stellar mass correlate most strongly with early assembly, while surviving satellites trace more recent accretion.

It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$\u039b$CDM, we find $\u03a9_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$\u03c3$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$\u03c3$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$\u03c3$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2\u03c3$ (up from 2.8$\u03c3$) and 3.4$\u03c3$ (down from 4.2$\u03c3$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w_0w_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fddIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u6d3d\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys\u7684\u5149\u5b66-\u7ea2\u5916\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Prospector\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u548cSED\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86Union3\u548cPantheon+\u4e2d\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e0eBAO\u548cCMB\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u53cd\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone.

While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups.

Symmetric top molecules, such as NH$_3$ and CH$_3$CCH, are often used as thermometers.

In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\\&$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m.

In this work, we use morphological statistics to explore the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to inflationary features and EoR dynamics simultaneously. Focusing on primordial features from particle production during inflation we generate semi-numerical simulations of the 21 cm signal across redshifts 5 < z < 35, incorporating these features. Using Minkowski Functionals (MFs), we analyze the morphology of 21 cm fields: density, neutral hydrogen fraction, spin temperature, and brightness temperature. We demonstrate that MFs are highly sensitive to both the amplitude and scale of primordial features, capturing rich morphological information. In particular, we show that MFs can robustly identify inflationary features and distinguish them from the standard model. We further explore various EoR scenarios, and demonstrate that combining MFs across redshifts can disentangle the signatures of primordial features from EoR effects. This approach opens new avenues for probing inflation with upcoming 21 cm surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a7621\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u66b4\u80c0\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u671f\uff08EoR\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Minkowski\u6cdb\u51fd\uff08MFs\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u66b4\u80c0\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u676521\u5398\u7c73\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "21\u5398\u7c73\u7ea2\u79fb\u4fe1\u53f7\u8574\u542b\u5b87\u5b99\u9ece\u660e\u548c\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u66b4\u80c0\u7b49\u539f\u521d\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d2221\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u66b4\u80c0\u7279\u5f81\u548cEoR\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u534a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u7ea2\u79fb5 < z < 35\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u768421\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u66b4\u80c0\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u539f\u521d\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u91c7\u7528Minkowski\u6cdb\u51fd\uff08MFs\uff09\u5206\u679021\u5398\u7c73\u573a\u7684\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u6c22\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "MFs\u5bf9\u539f\u521d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u8bc6\u522b\u66b4\u80c0\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684MFs\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u539f\u521d\u7279\u5f81\u548cEoR\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u672a\u676521\u5398\u7c73\u63a2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u66b4\u80c0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MFs\u5728\u539f\u521d\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Search for Transient Object in New observations using Known Sources (STONKS) is a near-real-time transient detection system for XMM-Newton offering the capability to detect transients in XMM-Newton observations at fainter fluxes than can be achieved with wide survey instruments. We present the transients detected with the STONKS pipeline found in an XMM-Newton multi-year heritage survey of the Galactic plane to identify and classify highly variable X-ray sources that have recently been reported in this region. We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $\u03b3$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations.

Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3\\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C.

We tentatively find that at even lower metallicities, the MF becomes very bottom-light, with a near-flat power-law slope of alpha ~ 0 that implies a severe deficit of low-mass stars. This metallicity-dependent variation is insensitive to the adopted stellar evolution model. These results show that the Galactic low-mass MF is not universal, with variations in the metal-poor regime. A further calibration of XP metallicities in the regime of M < 0.5 M_sun and [Fe/H] < -1.5 will be essential to verify these tentative low-metallicity trends.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\uff080.2-0.5 M_sun\uff09\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6[Fe/H] < -1\u65f6\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08MF\uff09\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MF\u659c\u7387\u968f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5728\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6[Fe/H] < -1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Gaia DR3 BP/RP\uff08XP\uff09\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDSS-V\u7684\u6052\u661f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u7ea653,000\u9897\u8d2b\u91d1\u5c5e\u6052\u661f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u659c\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728-1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cMF\u659c\u7387\u4e3aalpha ~ -1.6\uff08\u5e95\u90e8\u8f83\u91cd\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u66f4\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u659c\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e73\u5766\uff08alpha ~ 0\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u53d7\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u968f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6821\u51c6[Fe/H] < -1.5\u65f6\u7684XP\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level.

By significantly expanding the area covered by the original VVV survey, VVVX enables a deeper and broader exploration of the most obscured and crowded regions of the Milky Way. We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters.

We do a complete census of filaments in Cygnus X and quantify their links to dense cores, the magnetic field (B field), and HII regions. Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host > 93% of high-mass cores (>= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (> 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion.

Beyond this point, the evolution equations become non-predictive and perturbative approaches break down. We show that in General Relativity, a matter horizon forms before caustics develop for a well-defined initial over-density on an expanding FLRW spacetime. The matter horizon was first identified by Ellis and Stoeger in 2010 as a dynamical causal boundary that encloses a sub-region of spacetime where structure formation actually takes place. We construct a multi-scale hierarchical framework for the propagation of geodesic congruences that avoids the shell-crossing singularity by cutting the spacetime at the matter horizon and glueing to another spacetime with opposite orientation. We identify a relationship between the multi-scale hierarchical framework and the cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approach, and relate the local sub-region that decouples from the Hubble flow to the region of interest in cosmological zoom-in N-body simulations.

Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific \"sweet spot,\" success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\u03b7_{\\rm cum} \\approx 19\\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Unlike traditional methods reliant on optical imaging, our radio-based selection allows for the identification of dust-obscured or optically faint star-forming galaxies. Of the 140 CHIME FRBs considered, 33 lie within the LoTSS DR2 footprint, and 16 show potential radio counterparts. Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$\u03b1$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies. Our results highlight the value of low-frequency radio data in complementing optical host searches and demonstrate the feasibility of host identification even in the absence of optical confirmation.

They are generally standardized under the assumption that they belong to a single population, with luminosities standardized in a continuous (roughly linear) fashion using the observed light-curve timescale. We update the Union3+UNITY1.5 SN cosmology analysis in light of increasing evidence for at least two core populations of SNe Ia and apply this \"UNITY1.8\" model to the updated \"Union3.1\" compilation (Hoyt et al. 2026). In addition to finding evidence for two different light-curve-shape (x1) distributions, we also find that the color distributions are different, that the light-curve-shape/magnitude standardization relations are different, and that these populations have different distributions across host-galaxy stellar mass and redshift. Importantly, we find that the residual host-mass luminosity step found in prior SN Ia cosmology analyses is now consistent with zero for unreddened SNe. We report a significantly tightened constraint on the split in the red-color standardization between SNe in low- and high-mass galaxies. We find that the estimated uncertainties shrink on cosmological parameters when fitting the same SNe assuming two modes versus one mode. We confirm similar trends in simulated data when running both versions of UNITY on the same (two-mode) simulations. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find Om = 0.334+0.025-0.024 from SNe alone; for a flat w0-wa cosmology, we find w0 = -0.760+0.084-0.082 and wa = -0.79+0.28-0.30 when including SNe, BAO, and CMB. In the 2D w0-wa plane, adding SNe to BAO and compressed CMB increases the tension with flat LambdaCDM from 2.1 sigma to 2.6 sigma.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff08SNe Ia\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86Union3+UNITY1.5\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u7fa4\u4f53\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ea2\u79fb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524dSNe Ia\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u5355\u4e00\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u81f3\u5c11\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff08UNITY1.8\uff09\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3SNe Ia\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Union3.1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528UNITY1.8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790SNe Ia\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u5149\u66f2\u7ebf\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u989c\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u7ea2\u79fb\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0e\u53cc\u7fa4\u4f53\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u62df\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u7fa4\u4f53\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982Om\u3001w0\u3001wa\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bbf\u4e3b\u8d28\u91cf\u4eae\u5ea6\u9636\u8dc3\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea2\u79fb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u7fa4\u4f53\u5047\u8bbe\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SNe Ia\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0eLambdaCDM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u3002"}}

This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents.

They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends.

The abstract has been modified to comply with the astro-ph length requirement", "summary": "Aims. We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$\u03b1$ surface brightness ($\u03a3$(H$\u03b1$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $\u03a3$(H$\u03b1$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$\u03b1$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $\u03a3$(H$\u03b1$) bins reach $\\sim$0.4 dex and $\\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $\u03a3$(H$\u03b1$), metallicity, EW(H$\u03b1$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f25\u6f2b\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\uff08DIG\uff09\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\uff08UM 462\u548cIIZw 40\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86DIG\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76DIG\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u672a\u5206\u8fa8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528VLT/MUSE\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u89e3\u6790\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u70ed\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u7ebf\u5b9a\u6807\u6cd5\u63a8\u7b97\u51fa\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528H\u03b1\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u533a\u5206HII\u548cDIG\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "DIG\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6c27\u4e30\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u661f\u7cfb\u5e73\u5747\u503c0.2 dex\uff08UM 462\uff09\u548c0.1 dex\uff08IIZw 40\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eHII\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u522b\u8fbe0.4 dex\u548c0.3 dex\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u53cd\u6620\u7535\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DIG\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7HII\u533a\u57df\u5149\u5b50\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u6fc0\u6ce2\u7535\u79bb\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8c28\u614e\u533a\u5206\u3002"}}

Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity.
