TL;DR: 该研究计算了太阳五个主要演化阶段中氖同位素（18Ne、19Ne、20Ne、21Ne和22Ne）的丰度，揭示了20Ne和22Ne的稳定性以及18Ne和19Ne的快速衰变，填补了氦燃烧和耗尽阶段数据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氖同位素的丰度对理解恒星演化和核合成具有重要意义，但现有文献中关于太阳氦燃烧和耗尽阶段的定量数据较少，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用Webnucleo Group开发的nucnet-tools包，基于标准原太阳成分初始丰度，在静态流体静力学燃烧条件下，假设各阶段温度和密度恒定，计算氖同位素的演化。

Result: 结果显示，20Ne和22Ne在太阳整个生命周期中占主导地位，而18Ne和19Ne在氢燃烧阶段或之后快速衰变。氦燃烧和耗尽阶段的预测提供了现有文献中较少报道的定量数据。

Conclusion: 这些结果为未来研究太阳和恒星演化、核合成路径及同位素建模提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The elemental abundances of neon isotopes provide valuable insights into stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling.

### [2] [The 2021 Hot-type Symbiotic Outburst of YY Herculis: An Optical Follow-up Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18596)
*L. S. Sonith,U. S. Kamath*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 本文通过喜马拉雅Chandra望远镜观测了YY Her的经典共生爆发，研究了其光谱演化和轨道相位依赖性，发现温度与光度估计在次级极小值相位最为可靠，并确认了椭圆效应对光曲线的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补对YY Her共生爆发的光谱演化和轨道相位依赖性的理解空白，特别是自1993年以来未进行过类似研究。

Method: 使用喜马拉雅Chandra望远镜在2021年至2023年间监测YY Her约1.5个轨道周期，分析其光谱演化，基于发射线通量估计温度和光度。

Result: 温度和光度估计在相位0.5（次级极小值）最可靠；爆发期间高温组分温度约1.41×10^5 K，光度约1020 L☉；一个轨道周期后分别降至约1.3×10^5 K和830 L☉。YY Her表现出热型和冷型爆发行为，与AG Dra类似。

Conclusion: 研究确认了椭圆效应对YY Her光曲线的贡献，并揭示了其爆发行为的多样性，为共生星的研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: We have followed up on the hot-type classical symbiotic outburst reported in YY Her using the Himalayan Chandra telescope. The outburst coincides with the secondary minima of the system. Approximately 12 similar brightening events have been reported between 1890 and 2020, with only the 1993 outburst being studied spectroscopically. In our study, we monitored the system from 2021 to 2023, covering $\sim$1.5 orbital cycles, providing an opportunity to understand the spectral evolution of the outburst over a complete orbital period of YY Her. We found that the temperature and luminosity estimations based on emission line fluxes exhibit orbital phase dependence. The values estimated at phase 0.5, corresponding to the secondary minimum, were the most reliable. The temperature of the hot component is $\approx 1.41 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$, and the luminosity is $\approx 1020 \, L_{\odot}$ during the outburst, reduced to $\approx 1.3 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$ and $\approx 830 \, L_{\odot}$ after one orbital cycle at phase 0.5. Temperature estimations during the outbursts suggest that YY Her exhibits both hot-type (2021) and cool-type (1993) behavior, similar to another symbiotic star, AG Dra. Using variations of the Ca II absorption lines, we confirmed the contribution of the ellipsoidal effect in secondary minima in the YY Her light curve.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 研究利用太阳轨道飞行器的高分辨率数据，结合光球磁场和日冕发射的多温度分析，探讨了暗晕的本质及其与活动区域的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解暗晕（dark halos）的性质，研究将光球磁场与不同温度的日冕发射联系起来，分析其在活动区域周围的分布特征。

Method: 结合Solar Orbiter的SO/PHI（光球磁场）和EUI（极紫外成像）数据，探测NOAA 12893活动区域周围暗晕区域的磁场和日冕发射强度随距离的变化。

Result: 暗晕的磁通密度与静默区类似但随距离变化显著，低温（≤1 MK）日冕发射低于静默区40%，高温（≥1.6 MK）则高于静默区但向外递减。暗晕外层磁通密度降低可能是低温发射减少的原因。

Conclusion: 暗晕的形成可能与磁场通量密度和加热机制有关，高温和低温环的不同结构对理解暗晕现象至关重要。

Abstract: At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\leq$1 MK is $\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.

### [4] [The Physics of Solar Energetic Particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18617)
*Donald V Reames*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了太阳高能粒子（SEPs）产生的两种机制：太阳喷流中的磁重联过程和快速CME驱动的无碰撞冲击波，分析了两种机制下的粒子特征和加速过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究太阳高能粒子（SEPs）的产生机制及其在不同环境下的加速特征，有助于理解太阳活动的物理过程及其对空间环境的影响。

Method: 对比分析了从太阳喷流（开放场线）和CME驱动冲击波（闭合场线）中产生的SEPs的特征，包括元素的丰度增强、电子加速和波-粒子相互作用等。

Result: 喷流中的SEPs具有3He和重元素的丰度特征，而产生于冲击波的SEPs会形成“存储区”，其谱强度随体积膨胀而降低。两种机制均可能为多冲击事件提供种子粒子。

Conclusion: SEPs的产生机制和加速过程复杂多样，其研究不仅揭示了太阳活动的物理机制，还为理解日冕与光球层的差异提供了线索。

Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are produced in two fundamental ways: at magnetic reconnection sites in solar jets and at collisionless shock waves driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). "Impulsive" SEP events, on open field lines from jets, have signature abundance enhancements of 3He and of increasingly heavy elements, and their outward streaming electrons drive type-III radio bursts. Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the "streaming limit." Downstream, a spatially-uniform "reservoir" of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements. As samples of the corona, SEP abundances also probe differences with the photosphere that depend upon the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements.

### [5] [Solar cycle irregularity study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18625)
*William A. Gardner,Antonio Napolitano*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 研究发现太阳黑子序列中两个不规则周期（27天和11年）的时相变化共享一个共同的模式或周期，周期约为164年，可能与太阳内部活动和行星驱动有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究太阳黑子序列中不规则周期的共同模式及其背后的物理机制。

Method: 通过测量时间相位延迟的平均值消除无关常数，分析剩余的延迟周期模式。

Result: 发现一个164年的共同周期，可能与太阳内部活动和行星驱动有关。

Conclusion: 太阳黑子序列的两个不规则周期可能由一个共同的现象驱动，支持行星驱动太阳发电机的假设。

Abstract: It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo.

Method: 利用太阳动力学天文台的高时空多波长观测数据，追踪日冕等离子体片的形成、撕裂及演化过程，并分析其加热、等离子体团动力学以及对重联速率的影响。

Result: 研究发现等离子体片的演化分为两个阶段：早期快速上升、撕裂频率低；后期上升减缓、撕裂频率增加。等离子体团的生成和抛射显著提高了重联速率，促进了快速重联的启动。

Conclusion: 等离子体团是磁通快速转移的关键载体，其形成和抛射显著增强了重联速率，推动了快速重联的发生，研究结果为理解磁重联机制提供了重要观测依据。

Abstract: Tearing instability, also known as plasmoid instability, is an effective mechanism to speed up magnetic reconnection process, working in a wide range of magnetized plasma systems with different spatial scales, ionization degrees, and collisionality. However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection.

Conclusion: 潮汐进动是DPVs长周期变率的一个可行且重要的机制，为未来研究提供了定量框架。

Abstract: We investigate whether the long photometric cycles observed in double-periodic variables (DPVs) can arise from nodal precession of a tilted accretion disk driven by the tidal torque of the companion. Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $β$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies -- sinusoidal and double-hump -- distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+β\le 90^\circ$ versus $i+β>90^\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies.

Conclusion: 截面扩展影响辐射冷却和发射曲线形状，为EUV晚期发射提供物理解释，并可作为诊断工具评估耀环扩展程度。

Abstract: Loop-aligned hydrodynamic modelings help better understand the thermodynamic evolution of flaring plasma confined in solar flare loops. Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset.

TL;DR: 研究太阳耀斑磁环长度与其热与非热辐射信号时间延迟的关系，发现长磁环与更大的时间延迟强相关，确认磁环几何形状对能量传输时间演化起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究太阳耀斑中磁环长度如何影响热和非热辐射信号的时间关系，以揭示能量传输的物理机制。

Method: 分析2013-2015年96个C、M、X级耀斑的软X射线、硬X射线和极紫外数据，计算硬X射线与软X射线峰值时间延迟Δt，并通过UV足点假设半圆形几何估算磁环长度L。

Result: 发现磁环长度L与Δt强相关（R=0.88）；通过不同相关系数阈值（RN>0.5和RN>0.8）的子集分析，相关性保持显著（R=0.87和R=0.91）。

Conclusion: 磁环几何形状在太阳耀斑能量传输的时间演化中起关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate how the magnetic loop length of solar flares relates to the timing between their thermal and nonthermal emission signatures. Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay Δt between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and Δt. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN > 0.5 and RN > 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN > 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN > 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds. The results provide direct observational confirmation that magnetic loop geometry plays a key role in governing the temporal evolution of energy transport in solar flares.

Abstract: How the solar atmosphere is heated from a temperature of about $5,000-6,000$\,K in the lower atmosphere to about $1-2$\,MK in the corona has challenged the astrophysical community for about 80 years. The same puzzle exists for the stellar coronae heating as well. In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere. The combined effects of shock compression and reconnection outflows then drive the formation of groups of spicules with a quasi-period of about $300$\,s and width of $\sim 200-500$\,km. The spicule upflows provide an averaged mass flux above $10^{-9}$\,kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to sustain the solar wind in coronal holes, and they continuously trigger further new local slow-mode waves and shocks. These waves supply an energy flux of $10-100$\,W\,m$^{-2}$ in the lower corona, and they are dissipated by heat conduction and compression heating to sustain the corona temperature of about $1$\,MK. The results also indicate that the upward propagating disturbances (PDs) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands are caused by both spicule upflows and slow-mode waves and shocks. Our findings help to understand the long standing problem of coronal heating and the origin of solar winds in coronal hole regions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效区分了双星与单星，并支持了低质量恒星系统中双星的普遍性，为后续研究提供了高质量的系统目录。

Abstract: The fundamental parameters of a low-mass star can potentially be determined from its photometry and astrometry. This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\sim13\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc. We use this \textit{Catalog} to provide lower limits on the multiplicity fraction for stars between $0.1$ and $0.7~M_{\odot}$.

Abstract: Using repeat imaging of a galaxy cluster taken over a seventeen-year baseline, we examine the impact that degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) has on photometric measurements of extended sources using the ACS/WFC on HST. We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\sim3000\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $>20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($>1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用自监督学习（SSL）和变分自编码器（VAE）相结合的方法预训练射电星系形态分类模型，结果表明生成式增强与标准图像增强结合可提升下游分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习依赖大量标记数据，但天文数据集规模大且复杂，因此希望通过自监督学习直接从无标记图像中提取结构，为下游任务提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的β-VAE从射电星系图像中生成视图，并结合基于视图的自监督学习方法训练模型。β-VAE在Radio Galaxy Zoo数据集上训练，平衡重构质量和生成因子解耦（如星系对称性）。

Conclusion: 生成式和对比式方法具有互补性，解耦感知的自监督学习是未来射电天文调查的有前景方向。

Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $β$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($β= 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $β$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $β$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用标准Band-4科学接收器和主天线的替代方案，替代原基线设计的独立1.5米天线水蒸气辐射计（WVR），旨在降低高频段的校准开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的独立1.5米天线WVR在高频段（30.5-116 GHz）的校准开销较大，且难以达到理想效果。新方案旨在通过利用现有设备降低成本，并提高水蒸气监测的代表性。

Method: 新方案使用标准Band-4科学接收器和主天线，将Band-4馈源放置在Band 5和6之间，形成0.8度的波束偏移。这种方法利用低温接收器的优势，降低系统稳定性要求。

Result: Band-4 WVR方案可以更准确地监测对流层低层的水蒸气，显著降低系统稳定性要求，并减少独立设备的采购和维护成本。

Conclusion: 论文建议详细比较Band-4 WVR方案与独立系统的优缺点，并推荐进一步考虑新方案的可行性。

Abstract: The ngVLA has adopted a standalone system with a $\sim$~1.5 m diameter antenna and associated ambient temperature receiver and electronics at each antenna as its baseline design for water vapor radiometer (WVR). The WVR is intended to decrease calibration overheads for tropospheric phase correction for the high frequency bands (5 \& 6; 30.5-116 GHz) to levels lower than feasible with fast switched reference gain calibration.
  In this memo, we present an alternative concept utilizing the standard Band-4 science receivers and the main antennas. This would require the Band-4 feed to be placed between those of Bands 5 \& 6 resulting in a beam offset of 0.8 deg, similar to the beam size of the standalone 1.5 m antenna. The main benefits of the Band-4 WVR concept are: (1) sensing water vapor in a region more representative of the Band 5 \& 6 science beams in the lower layers of the troposphere, in the near-field of the 18 m antenna, than the 1.5 m antenna (2) significantly relaxing the stability requirements due to the lower receiver temperature of the standard Band-4 cryogenic receiver and (3) eliminating the procurement, deployment, and maintenance of a large number of standalone units. Given these advantages, it is recommended that the details and the pros and cons of Band-4 WVR implementation compared a standalone system be carefully considered.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析约22,000个紧凑射电源的数据，发现VLBI天体测量属性与红移无关，而光学天体测量属性（如射电-光学偏移）则表现出明显的红移依赖行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前基于ICRF3的研究提出了活动星系核（AGN）天体测量属性与红移的相关性。本研究旨在通过更大的样本量和系统性分析验证这一关系。

Method: 使用RFC目录中的约22,000个射电源数据，结合DESI DR1、SDSS DR17/19以及NED的数据，匹配Gaia DR3获得4,068个可靠样本，分析其VLBI和Gaia天体测量属性的红移依赖性。

Result: VLBI属性无显著红移依赖性；光学属性（如射电-光学偏移、G星等）在不同红移区间表现出明显变化，主要由Gaia性能和G星等演化解释。

Conclusion: 光学天体测量属性的红移依赖行为为理解AGN的物理特性提供了新线索，可能与Gaia仪器的性能及AGN的光学演化相关。

Abstract: Previous studies based on the latest realisation of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) have suggested a correlation between astrometric properties (such as the radio-optical offset) and redshift for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 < z < 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 < z < 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 < z < 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z > 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了哈勃太空望远镜（HST）的STIS目标获取序列（ACQ）因未能及时锁定导星而失败的频率，并提出在多轨道观测中设置冗余ACQ序列以恢复指向精度的可行性。

Motivation: 研究目标是解决HST STIS ACQ序列因导星锁定延迟导致的指向精度不足问题，尤其是在非重复观测（如超新星、千新星等）中，以确保科学数据能在特定时间窗口内成功获取。

Method: 研究者选取了2018年9月至2023年9月间113个出现问题的STIS ACQ序列子集，分析了故障频率和恢复情况，并探讨在多轨道观测中增加冗余ACQ序列的可行性。

Result: 约5%的STIS ACQ序列在此期间出现故障，其中2023年3月至9月的故障率上升至9%。多轨道观测中39%完全未锁定导星，78%在第二轨道科学观测开始前恢复锁定。

Conclusion: 研究表明冗余ACQ序列可帮助恢复指向精度，尤其在多轨道观测中。研究者还提供了风险评估建议，以帮助用户应对此类问题。

Abstract: For observations of supernovae, kilonovae, tidal disruption events, and other non-repeatable observations, it is important the science data is taken successfully within a specific time window. Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or "safety" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here.

Motivation: 由于火球及其碎片事件的光度动态范围大（高达10星等），传统测量方法复杂且成本高，因此需要一种高效且精确的采样光度测量系统。

Conclusion: 该系统将作为全球火球观测台下一代仪器的核心组件，与高分辨率天体测量相机协同工作，实现精确轨道数据和高质量光度曲线的同步采集。

Abstract: Fast sampling photometry is essential for characterising fireballs and their fragmentation episodes which link to the meteoroid internal structure. Accurate measurements remain challenging due to the large required dynamic range of up to 10 stellar magnitudes driving up operational complexity and cost. We developed an all-sky camera system operating at up to 500 frames per second featuring a novel Detection Localised Auto-brightness Control. Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems.

Motivation: 研究SiPM与PMT在现代地面甚高能伽马射线天文观测中的性能差异，探索SiPM在高噪声环境中能否优于PMT。

Method: 在MAGIC望远镜的成像相机中并行安装并运行SiPM和PMT模块，长期对比两者的信号噪声比（SNR）。

Result: SiPM因夜天光噪声显著增加，尽管光子探测效率更高，性能仅与PMT相当。

Conclusion: SiPM在高噪声环境下未能显著优于PMT，未来发展的SPAD阵列可能提供更好的解决方案。

Abstract: The use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) alongside conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) is a remarkable technological development in modern ground-based very high energy gamma-ray astronomy. SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs.

Conclusion: NBM能够提供可靠的小时级预测，适用于ASTRI-Horn的在线监测时间序列分析，支持预测性维护系统的未来发展。

Abstract: This study presents a Normal Behavior Model (NBM) developed to forecast monitoring time-series data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope under normal operating conditions. The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.

Motivation: 氨基酸是寻找地外生命的关键目标，但其来源可能是生命或非生命过程，传统方法（如同位素或手性分析）易受物理化学过程干扰。LUMOS旨在提供一种不依赖于特定氨基酸集的生物特征。

Method: LUMOS通过量化样本中氨基酸的HLG分布差异来区分生命与非生命来源。分析了多种环境和来源的氨基酸数据集，发现生命样本的HLG分布更不均匀且偏好低HLG氨基酸。

Result: LUMOS在不同环境（包括地外样本）中区分生命与非生命来源的准确率超过95%，表明生命系统中分子反应性的多样性可能是普遍特征。

Conclusion: LUMOS是一种通用且与现有仪器兼容的生物特征工具，未来通过更多环境数据的积累可进一步明确生命与非生命化学系统的边界。

Abstract: Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves >95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.

Conclusion: 早期地球陨石坑为脂质体聚集和生命起源提供了理想环境，周期性地震扰动是重要推动因素。

Abstract: This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.

Result: 喷流位置角分析得到周期Pjet=7.20±0.05小时，光度分析得到周期Pphot=7.136±0.001小时，两者一致性较高；喷流方向存在约20度的进动角，自转轴与向阳方向偏差约20度。

Conclusion: 3I/ATLAS的自转周期约为7.1小时，且存在姿态进动或章动现象，喷流方向及光度变化反映了其动力学行为的周期性特征。

Abstract: We analyse data on the post-perihelion morphology, including jet position angles (PAs) and coma dominated photometry of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. From Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images processed with a Larson Sekanina rotational gradient filter, we measure the PAs of three main persistent jet like features between November 30 and December 27, 2025 and fit a weighted Fourier model in a period scan. The dominant jet PA wobble yields Pjet = 7.20 +/- 0.05 h. An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution. The jet structure precesses about the rotation axis with a characteristic angular excursion of order about 20 degs, and the rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within about 20 degs.

Motivation: 研究火星的两颗卫星同时凌日的现象，填补了这一领域的空白，并为未来的天文观测提供理论支持。

Method: 利用JPL的mar099星历表和SPICE工具包，分析了1600年至2600年内火星表面观测到的双卫星凌日事件，分类统计了不同类型的事件。

Result: 共发现8565次掠食事件、49次部分重叠事件和17次完全重叠事件。研究还确定了未来可观测的双星凌日时间（2034年和2118年）。

Conclusion: 火星双卫星凌日事件集中在赤道附近，未来可通过JAXA的MMX任务提高预测精度。

Abstract: I present the first systematic catalogue of simultaneous solar transits of both Phobos and Deimos as observed from the surface of Mars. Using the JPL mar099 ephemeris (Brozovic et al. 2025) and SPICE toolkit, I searched the millennium 1600-2600 CE for epochs at which both Martian moons project onto the solar disc at the same instant for at least one surface location. I identify 8565 grazing double transits, 49 partial-overlap double transits (both moons simultaneously on the solar disc, with at least one partially cut off by the limb), and 17 full double transits in which both moons lie wholly within the solar disc at the same moment. All events cluster tightly around the Martian equinoxes (Ls ~ 0 deg or 180 deg) and within +/- 9 deg of the equator, reflecting the near-equatorial orbital inclinations of both moons. I derive a hard theoretical latitude limit of +/- 13.1 deg beyond which simultaneous double transits are geometrically impossible. The next observable partial double transit, excluding less prominent grazing events, is predicted for 2034 April 17. The next full double transit, with both moons wholly inside the solar disc, with a gap between each silhouette and the solar limb, occurs on 2118 November 20. The geometries for both these events were confirmed with JPL Horizons. I provide uncertainty estimates based on the Brozovic et al. covariance model, with predicted position errors growing from ~1 km for near-term events to ~600 km at the catalogue boundaries, and note that the JAXA MMX mission (~2031) will dramatically reduce uncertainties for all post-2030 predictions.

Motivation: 研究海王星族行星的动态起源，特别是通过恒星倾角测量来约束其可能的迁移机制（如高偏心率迁移）。

Method: 使用Magellan/PFS和WIYN/NEID的高分辨率光谱仪进行Rossiter-McLaughlin观测，测量了TOI-181 b和TOI-883 b的轨道倾角和偏心率，并与其他数据结合分析恒星倾角分布。

Result: TOI-181 b的轨道倾角为32.0°（误差±6°），偏心率低（e<0.12）；TOI-883 b的轨道倾角为22°（误差±14°），偏心率为0.16±0.03。现有数据不支持恒星倾角双峰分布的假说，更倾向于大部分系统轨道对齐，少部分倾角随机。

Conclusion: 海王星族行星的动态特征与大质量行星（如木星族）类似，可能源于相似的动力学过程。

Abstract: We present the first results from the POSEIDON survey, aimed at constraining the dynamical origins of transiting Neptunes through stellar obliquity measurements. We report Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of two Neptunes, TOI-181 b and TOI-883 b, obtained with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/PFS and WIYN/NEID. TOI-181 b is on a 4.5-day orbit with a sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment $λ= 32.0_{-6.5}^{+6.3}\,^{\circ}$ and a low eccentricity ($e<0.12$ with $2σ$ confidence). TOI-883 b has a longer orbital period of 10 days with $λ= 22_{-14}^{+15}\,^{\circ}$ and eccentricity $e = 0.16 \pm 0.03$. The significant misalignment of TOI-181 b and the significant eccentricity of TOI-883 b are suggestive of high-eccentricity migration for both systems. After adding these and other new measurements to the sample, we analyze the obliquity distribution of the host stars of transiting Neptunes. Earlier studies had suggested that the obliquity distribution is bimodal, with peaks corresponding to aligned orbits and polar orbits; the addition of more measurements has weakened the evidence for bimodality. The current sample appears to be consistent with a population of well-aligned systems and a smaller population with nearly random obliquities. This distribution resembles that observed for more massive planets, suggesting that transiting Jupiters and Neptunes originate from similar dynamical processes.

TL;DR: 该研究通过高密度光度测量，系统调查了249颗近地小行星的旋转特性，发现快速旋转在小尺寸小行星中占主导地位，并表明这些天体需要适度的内聚强度来避免旋转破裂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是量化小尺寸近地小行星快速旋转的普遍性，描述其自转速率分布，从而约束其内部强度及演化历史。

Method: 研究使用双米双筒望远镜（TTT）对249颗近地小行星进行了高密度光度测量，通过密集时间序列数据推导旋转周期和振幅。

Result: 研究发现156颗新的快速旋转体（P < 2.2小时），其中87颗旋转周期小于10分钟。随着绝对星等的增加，快速旋转体的比例显著上升。98个目标需要超过松散碎石堆的内聚强度，22个目标仅与高强度的致密内部结构兼容。

Conclusion: 研究表明，快速旋转在尺寸小于几十米的近地小行星中是普遍现象，且这些天体需要适度的内聚强度以避免旋转破裂。这是首次针对如此小尺寸小行星旋转特性的系统性调查。

Abstract: The rotational properties of small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) provide crucial insights into their internal structure and collisional history. However, systematic surveys targeting metre- to decametre-sized bodies are rare, thus leaving their spin distribution poorly constrained. Our aim was to quantify the prevalence of fast rotation and characterise the spin-rate distribution of small NEAs to constrain their internal strength and evolution. We conducted a dedicated high-cadence photometric survey of 249 NEAs using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT). Rotation periods and amplitudes were derived from dense time series to classify objects as fast or non-fast rotators. We determined the rotation period of 156 new fast rotators (P < 2.2 h), including 87 that rotate faster than 10 min. The prevalence of fast rotators increases with absolute magnitude: from 60.6-80.3 % for 22 < H < 24 to 77.3-89.4 % for 24 < H < 26 and 94.1-96.1 % for H > 26, indicating that fast rotation dominates in the small NEA population. Most objects spin faster than the gravity-defined limit; 98 targets require cohesive strengths exceeding that of weak rubble piles, and 22 are compatible only with compact, high-strength interiors. This is the first systematic survey targeting the rotation of such small NEAs, providing the largest homogeneous sample of fast rotators obtained by a single campaign. Our findings demonstrate that fast rotation is the norm for objects smaller than tens of metres, implying that modest cohesive strength is required to prevent their rotational disruption.

Abstract: We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models.

Conclusion: 火星中纬度地下冰层可能是63万年前高倾斜时期地表冰层的残留，其空间分布特征可通过改进的气候模型解释。

Abstract: On Mars, a relatively pure water ice layer lies beneath several centimeters of dry soil at mid-latitudes. Its widespread presence poleward of 60° latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68°N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35° latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35° obliquity (40°), at latitudes of 40-55°N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago. We therefore infer that the mid-latitude subsurface ice is younger than 4 Myr.

TL;DR: Tempawral是一个新型的时间分辨大气反演框架，通过特征光谱反演技术定量估计褐矮星和系外行星大气参数的变化。该方法成功应用于模拟数据和JWST观测数据，揭示了温度、云层厚度和化学成分的动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 褐矮星和系外行星的大气中存在复杂的动态现象（如云层、风暴和化学不均匀性），但现有技术难以定量表征这些变化。Tempawral旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用特征光谱反演技术（eigen-spectra inversion）和时间序列光谱数据，Tempawral定量反演大气参数（如温度、云层厚度和化学成分）的变异性。

Result: 在模拟数据和JWST对T2.5褐矮星的观测中，Tempawral成功捕捉到了温度扰动（约300 K）、水、一氧化碳、氢化铁丰度的变化以及铁云层厚度的动态调整。

Conclusion: Tempawral为JWST时代的时间分辨大气反演提供了通用框架，能够全面解读亚恒星天体中的动态大气过程。

Abstract: Brown dwarfs and exoplanets are thought to host complex atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, storms, and chemical heterogeneity, akin to weather patterns on Earth. These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\rm H_{2}O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects.

Abstract: The Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA) will study the ultra-red asteroid (269)~Justitia. In this work, we present the first detailed investigation of Justitia's surface dynamics using the newly developed 3-D polyhedral shape model with 574 vertices and 1,144 faces. We analyze its geopotential, surface acceleration, escape speeds, slopes, and equilibrium points, and we also search for planar symmetric periodic orbits using an equivalent ellipsoidal approximation. Our results indicate that the lowest geopotential values occur at the poles, which also correspond to regions of maximum surface acceleration. The global slope distribution suggests preferred zones of material accumulation or migration, offering clues to Justitia's long-term morphological evolution. Most slopes remain below $40^\circ$, implying that loose particles may settle stably across large portions of the surface. We identify five equilibrium points consistent with Justitia's estimated density and slow rotational period. Two external points (E$_2$ and E$_4$) exhibit linear stability, and all equilibrium locations lie relatively far from the surface due to the body's slow spin. Additionally, we discover 28 new families of planar symmetric periodic orbits, then classify their topologies and determine their linear stability, providing a dynamical framework relevant to future spacecraft operations near Justitia. Finally, thermal modeling reveals how thermal inertia and heliocentric distance shape Justitia's temperature distribution. The south pole receives more insolation than the north pole, reaching minimum temperatures of about 102~K and 87~K, respectively. These combined dynamical and thermal results offer valuable insights for the EMA mission and for understanding slowly rotating small bodies.

Method: 开发了基于JAX库的Python框架Exo Skryer，支持可扩展的高效前向模拟和后验采样，并提供了一种直接反推测光学常数（n, k）的新方法。

Conclusion: Exo Skryer因其高效性，适合未来更复杂的反演需求，包括多维空间模型和高维参数集。

Abstract: Contemporary exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheric research relies heavily on retrieval frameworks to recover thermal and chemical properties and perform model comparison in an observational data-driven approach. However, the computational effort required for retrieval modelling has rapidly increased, driven by JWST data that covers large spectral intervals at moderate spectral resolutions, and ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy. To help tackle the computational burden faced by contemporary retrieval requirements, I present a new sub-stellar atmosphere retrieval modelling framework, Exo Skryer, that utilises the JAX library for Python to enable scalable, computationally efficient forward modelling as well as posterior sampling. I present example retrievals for pre- and current JWST era observations for both transmission and emission spectra, finding consistent results to previous retrieval modelling efforts, apart from a WASP-107b test case. In addition, I present a new method to directly retrieve the real and imaginary optical constants (n, k) of suspected aerosol infrared absorption features. Due to its computational expediency, Exo Skryer will be highly suited for future demanding retrieval efforts that incorporate more spatial dimensionality, complex forward models and high-dimensional parameter sets.

Abstract: The main belt, the region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is home to more than 1 million asteroids. These asteroids form orbital groups, (i.e., asteroid families formed by collisions) and also spectral groups (taxonomies) with different chemical compositions, in particular carbonaceous (C-types) and silicate (S-types). In this paper, we extend the existing main-belt collisional model by finding the appropriate strength-versus-size dependence (also known as the scaling law) for these two groups. We used color indices and geometric albedos of 56 and 72 spectroscopically confirmed C- and S-types (control samples), along with statistical methods on 1 065 034 asteroids, to assign C-, S-, or other types. This allowed us to construct observed size-frequency distributions (SFDs) for several subpopulations constrained by either semimajor axis (inner, middle, outer) or taxonomy (C, S, other). Then we used a Monte Carlo collisional model to compute the long-term collisional evolution (4.5 billion years) and derive synthetic SFDs. Our best-fit scaling laws indicate that S-types must be weaker below approximately 0.2 km than C-types to explain the deficiency of asteroids in the inner part of the main belt near (and below) the observational limit. This may correspond to differences in chemical composition or material porosity. Future research will focus on the scaling laws of asteroids with rare or "extreme" taxonomies (e.g., V, M).

Motivation: 研究AT Pyx系统以了解行星形成在非典型环境（彗状球体中的高辐射驱动结构）中的可能性，填补此类环境下的行星形成研究空白。

Method: 结合VLT的XSHOOTER、ESPRESSO、SPHERE及ALMA数据，通过几何、光度测量及速度分量映射，分析盘的特征（如螺旋臂）和环境动态。

Result: 发现盘为偏心结构，推测行星质量范围为0.004至3倍木星质量；AT Pyx可能为双星系统，且环境中远紫外场强度较低。

Conclusion: AT Pyx是首个在彗状球体中空间分辨率较高的盘，研究为未来在Gum Nebula中等FUV环境下盘的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents new data and analyses of the AT Pyx system, a disk-hosting young star located in a cometary globule in the Gum Nebula. This radiation-driven structure is an unusual environment for observations of planet formation and differs greatly from the low-mass star-forming regions disks are most commonly observed in. Aided by a collection of visual and spectroscopic data available for this system, this paper aims to infer the possibility of embedded planets existing within the disk and how the system's environment may affect its disk morphology. Using data from the VLT's instruments XSHOOTER, ESPRESSO and - most prominently - SPHERE along with data from ALMA, we make a variety of measurements (geometric, photometric and otherwise) to characterise the observed disk features and attributes such as spiral arms and eccentricity. Mapping of the velocity components is also undertaken using the ALMA gas line data to characterise disk orientation and determine the likelihood that the system is experiencing a late-stage infall event. The disk is found to be eccentric when deprojected. Under the assumption that the formation of a planet is wholly responsible for the primary and secondary spiral arms, we find the mass of such a planet can range between 0.004 and 3 Jupiter masses. Measurement of the velocities associated with nearby globule cloud material returns reasonable velocities for a late-stage infall event. We estimate far-ultraviolet field strength at AT Pyx's location to be low in comparison to other surveyed disks. We also find that AT Pyx is possibly a binary system. AT Pyx is the first disk within a cometary globule to be spatially resolved, and is now the first such disk to be investigated to this extent. The work of this paper could potentially be a first step into the further study of disks in the moderate-FUV environment of the Gum Nebula and its globules.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析阿波菲斯的来源群体（如Flora家族）及其轨道特性，评估其在长期内的地球撞击风险与其他可能的演化结局。

Method: 通过对Flora家族近十亿年的轨道模拟，计算类似阿波菲斯的小行星的数量、轨道持久性、接近概率及捕获可能性，并统计最终命运（太阳接近或撞击行星）。

Result: 研究发现：(1)类似阿波菲斯的小行星在近地空间持久存在；(2)其地球近距离接近概率较低（每430000年一次），但长期撞击概率为19%；(3)最终45%接近太阳，50%撞击行星。

Conclusion: 尽管阿波菲斯短期内无威胁，但其长期命运难以预测。类似轨道的小行星在长期演化中可能撞击地球或接近太阳，概率分布明确。

Abstract: We provide context for Apophis' 2029 Earth passage by analyzing its possible source populations, in particular, the Flora family, which has a similar composition, corresponding to LL chondrite meteorites. Out of ${\sim}3380$ NEOs larger or equal than Apophis (${\ge}420\,{\rm m}$), $610\pm 140$ are LL-like NEOs from Flora. Their mean encounter probability is $p = 86\times 10^{-18}\,{\rm km}^{-2}\,{\rm y}^{-1}$, corresponding to once per 13000 y frequency of encounters closer than 38000 km. However, this does not apply to Apophis alone, for which the specific encounter probability is higher, $p' = 1603\times 10^{-18}\,{\rm km}^{-2}\,{\rm y}^{-1}$, but the frequency is lower, only once per 430000 y, when we consider it as a single object. Our simulation of the Flora family over $\sim$1 billion years indicates that Apophis-like bodies have orbits that are particularly persistent in near-Earth space. The temporal distribution of encounter probabilities exhibits peaks (up to ${>}10^4$ in the same units) and the specific value for Apophis is not unusual (occurring ${\sim}70\%$ of time). In other words, there is always at least one Apophis-like body among NEOs. We find that such persistence also creates favorable opportunities for temporary capture as Earth coorbitals. Apophis-like bodies are ultimately removed from the inner solar system by approaching the Sun or by impact into one of the terrestrial planets, where the relative split between these outcomes is $(45\pm 2)\,\%$ and $(50\pm 2)\,\%$. While our current knowledge of Apophis' orbit guarantees no threat from Apophis in the next few centuries, we cannot predict any specific outcome for Apophis in the coming thousands or millions of years. Evaluating this statistically over the long term, we find that objects in Apophis-like orbits have a $(19\pm 2)\,\%$ chance of Earth impact over their lifetime of ${\sim}30\,{\rm My}$.

Abstract: We present deep, high-resolution ($\sim$100 mas) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9.1 mm) observations of the disk around MWC 480, and infer dust properties through a combined analysis with archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data at 0.87, 1.17, 1.33, and 3.0 mm. The prominent dust ring at 95 au (B95) is detected at 9.1 mm for the first time, while the faint outer ring at 160 au is not revealed. Through non-parametric visibility modeling, we identified two new annular features: a plateau within 20-50 au across all wavelengths, and a shoulder exterior to the B95 ring at 0.87, 1.17 and 1.33 mm, consistent with signatures of planet-disk interaction. We find that the width of the B95 ring remains constant across wavelengths, suggesting that fragmentation dominates over radial diffusion or that unresolved substructure is present within the ring. Resolved spectral modeling yields two families of dust solutions that reproduce the observations equally well: compact grains or highly porous (90\%) grains, with carbonaceous components dominated by refractory organics or amorphous carbon, respectively. The inferred maximum grain sizes peak at the locations of the two rings and reach centimeter within the B95 ring. The total dust masses are $860^{+95}_{-78}\rm~M_\oplus$/$1500^{+440}_{-330}\rm~M_\oplus$ (large/small-grain solution in inner disk) and $230^{+14}_{-13}\rm~M_\oplus$ for the two dust mixtures. The B95 ring alone contains $100^{+5}_{-5}\rm~M_\oplus$ and $43^{+2}_{-2}\rm~M_\oplus$, respectively, sufficient to assemble the cores of giant planets. Finally, we highlight the power of broadband, multi-wavelength observations in placing better constraints on dust composition and porosity in protoplanetary disks.

Method: 使用WHT望远镜的ACAM仪器，在495-874 nm波长范围内获得低分辨率透射光谱，精度为246 ppm。通过大气反演分析光谱特征。

Result: 检测到钠吸收（3.9σ置信度）、水蒸气和瑞利散射的证据，表明大气温度为800 K，金属丰度为7倍太阳值。排除了超瑞利散射斜坡或高层云（<1 mbar）的存在。

Conclusion: HAT-P-44b的光谱特征与WASP-39b高度相似，支持其在热木星分类中的典型性，为LRG-BEASTS调查提供了重要数据。

Abstract: We present the low-resolution optical transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Saturn HAT-P-44b. The planet is a close sibling in radius (1.24 $\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$), temperature (1100 K), and mass (0.35 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$) to the exceedingly well-characterized WASP-39b. Using the ACAM instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), we obtain a transmission spectrum with sub-scale height precision of 246 ppm, with a wavelength range of 495 -- 874 nm and a 20 nm resolution, despite a relatively faint host star ($V\mathrm{_{mag} = 13.2}$). We detect absorption due to sodium with 3.9$σ$ confidence. Atmospheric retrieval of the transmission spectrum also reveals evidence for \ch{H2O} absorption and Rayleigh scattering from \ch{H2} gas consistent with a cool 800 K atmosphere and a super-solar metallicity of 7$\substack{+16 \\ -5}$$\times$solar. Comparison of retrieval models disfavour the inclusion of a super-Rayleigh scattering slope or high-altitude clouds (at $<1$ mbar) while being agnostic towards the presence of mid-altitude clouds. Our transmission spectrum of HAT-P-44b shows strong similarity to that of its sibling WASP-39b.} This is the tenth planet in the LRG-BEASTS (Low-Resolution Ground-Based Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey using Transmission Spectroscopy) survey.

TL;DR: 研究分析了347颗TESS任务观测到的温暖系外行星（周期8-200天）的半径依赖性偏心分布，发现其由低偏心率和高偏心率两种模式组成，其中高偏心率比例随行星半径增加而显著上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究温暖单行星系统的偏心分布，以揭示其动力学历史和形成机制。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯框架中的“光偏效应”方法，分别对行星大小离散分组和连续混合模型进行分析。

Result: 发现温暖单行星系统主要由低偏心率（<e_low> = 0.070）和高偏心率（<e_high> = 0.616）两种模式组成，高偏心率比例随行星半径增加，且在R_br = 9.8 R_e处有显著过渡。59%的温暖木星位于高偏心率模式。

Conclusion: 温暖气态巨星的偏心分布具有双峰性，表明其形成或演化路径多样；同时发现一部分高偏心率亚海王星可能与外部伴星有关。

Abstract: We characterize the radius-dependent eccentricity distribution of 347 warm (P = 8-200 days) systems with only one transiting planetary candidate identified during Sectors 1-69 of the TESS mission. Using the ``photoeccentric effect'' in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we first model the population using discrete planetary size bins (sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, and Jovians). We then develop a continuous mixture model with weights governed by a logistic sigmoid function of radius. We find that the warm-single population is best described by two components: a dominant low-eccentricity mode ( <e_low> = 0.070-0.068+0.026) and a secondary dynamically excited mode (<e_high> = 0.616-0.075+0.091). The fraction of planets belonging to this high-eccentricity component increases strongly with planet radius, characterized by a transition at a break radius of R_br = 9.8-1.1+1.4 R_e. This trend places warm sub-Saturns predominantly on the same low-eccentricity track as sub-Neptunes. In contrast, warm Jovians (8--16 R_e) are frequently eccentric, with 59+-13% of the population in the high eccentricity mode. We detect this bimodality at >4sigma, providing statistically significant evidence that warm gas giants are sculpted by two distinct pathways, or a single mechanism with subsequent eccentricity excitation. Finally, we identify a non-negligible tail of highly eccentric sub-Neptunes (1--4 R_e), which comprise 14.9-6.5+5.1% of the population, consistent with excitation by non-transiting external companions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M矮星周围的岩石行星具有潜在宜居性，但其气候可能与地球不同，尤其是在潮汐锁定条件下。研究地形和地形分布如何影响这些行星的气候对理解其宜居性至关重要。

Method: 通过一系列同步旋转实验，模拟不同地形和地形分布（如陡峭地形和广阔高原）对行星气候的影响，覆盖氮压范围0.5-8 bar和恒星通量1200-1700 W/m²。

Result: 地形破坏气流对称性，形成静止波和罗斯贝涡旋，增强了湿气传输和夜侧云形成，降低了全球冰冻所需的临界通量。广阔高原则导致较弱的气流分裂和较低的湿气传输效率。

Conclusion: 地形和陆地分布对潮汐锁定的M矮星行星气候分岔具有显著影响，这些参数在大多数系外行星中未受约束，但对宜居性至关重要。

Abstract: Among potentially habitable worlds, rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs offer the most favorable prospects for atmospheric characterization, yet their climates may differ substantially from those of Earth analogs. In the tidally locked limit, the nightside's tendency to radiatively cool and potentially trap volatiles as permanent ice introduces a strong dependence of habitability on the planet's surface and atmospheric boundary conditions. We perform a suite of synchronously rotating experiments spanning a wide range of topographic and orographic realizations with different mean elevations and landmass distributions. Across a grid of $p_{\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5$-$8~\mathrm{bar}$ and $F_{\star} = 1200$-$1700~\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$, we find that surface relief breaks the flow symmetry, replacing the circumpolar vortices with mechanically forced stationary waves. Steep orography produces standing Rossby gyres that strengthen the cross-terminator jet and align vertical uplift with the day--night boundary. These new circulation regimes enhance moisture transport, increasing the infrared optical depth and promoting additional nightside cloud formation, which produces a stronger cloud-greenhouse feedback and lower the critical fluxes required for global planetary deglaciation. Broad, elevated plateaus drive a similarly fragmented but slightly weaker circulation, yielding less effective moisture transport. These results show that the relief and spatial distribution of landmasses, parameters unconstrained for most exoplanets, can exert strong controls on the climatic bifurcations of tidally locked M-dwarf exoplanets.

TL;DR: 使用SDSS-V DR19数据研究银河系双星对表面化学丰度的影响，发现部分双星的[C/N]异常升高，可能与伴星污染有关，但整体上双星与单星化学性质一致。


<details>

Motivation: 探究近距离双星性对恒星表面化学丰度的广泛影响，特别是在疏散星团中，以理解双星系统对化学丰度及年龄测定的潜在干扰。

Method: 利用APOGEE数据和分析工具The Joker、UltraNest对103个单线光谱双星（SB1s）进行轨道参数和丰度分析，比较其与非双星恒星的化学丰度差异。

Result: 部分双星的[C/N]升高导致年龄高估，表明可能存在伴星污染；但整体上双星与单星化学性质无明显差异，且轨道间距不影响化学丰度变化。

Conclusion: 双星系统在化学丰度上与单星基本一致，但某些情况下[C/N]异常可能导致年龄测定偏差，需在银河系年龄研究中加以注意。

Abstract: Using SDSS-V DR19 Milky Way Mapper APOGEE data, we measure the impact that close binarity has on surface chemistry across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a broad set of abundances by studying single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in open clusters. We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $Δ$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity.

TL;DR: 研究分析了JWST/NIRSpec近红外光谱数据的高红移星系样本，揭示了它们的恒星质量、尘埃质量、气体相金属丰度及电离参数等特性，表明这些星系是高光度、化学演化的系统，偏离了标准尘埃-金属平衡模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过JWST和ALMA的协同观测，揭示高红移尘埃遮蔽星系（DSFGs）的星际介质特性，填补对其化学演化认识的空白。

Method: 基于48个高红移星系的JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据，结合多波长SED分析，测量了恒星质量、尘埃质量、金属丰度、电子密度及电离参数。

Result: 样本星系显示出高恒星质量（log₁₀(M*/M⊙)≈10.8）、高尘埃质量（log₁₀(Md/M⊙)≈8.7），金属丰度为12+log(O/H)=8.71，且高FIR光度星系偏离了基本金属丰度关系。

Conclusion: 高光度FIR星系是化学演化的系统，其特性不同于低遮蔽星系的标准模型，需进一步开展NIRSpec均匀样本研究以全面表征其星际介质。

Abstract: We present a detailed study of near-infrared (2-4$\rm μ$m) JWST/NIRSpec spectra of 48 high-redshift ($z=2.53^{+1.32}_{-0.70}$) galaxies detected with ALMA at $>3σ$. From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot)=10.8\pm0.1$ and dust mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_{\rm d}/M_\odot)=8.7\pm0.1$, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity $\rm (\log_{10}(L_{FIR}/L_\odot)=10.9-12.7)$. The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts $(\rm L_{Xc}>10^{42}erg/s)$, elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM>800 km/s) H$α$ profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log({\rm O/H})=8.71\pm0.02$, as derived from the [NII]/H$α$ ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies ($\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)>12$) falling $0.15\pm0.03$dex above the fundamental metallicity relation. From the [SII] emission-line doublet ratio, we measure a median electron density of $\log_{10}(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm}^{-3})=2.53\pm0.07$ consistent with less-massive, star-forming, galaxies at the same epoch. For nine galaxies with [OII] and H$β$ detections (median $\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)=11.81\pm0.15$), we derive a median observed (dust-uncorrected) ionisation parameter of $\rm\log_{10}(U)=-2.84\pm0.06$. Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.

TL;DR: 通过生成合成HI Zeeman光谱并分析Stokes I和V谱线，提出了两种方法评估LOS磁场测量的准确性和局限性，展示了Zeeman分析的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Zeeman观测在星际介质中LOS磁场测量的准确性和局限性，为实际观测提供方法学支持。

Method: 提出了两种方法：方法Ⅰ基于Stokes V和dI/dν的经典关系估计LOS平均磁场；方法Ⅱ通过高斯分解分析Stokes I和V谱线，估计分量级磁场。

Result: 方法Ⅰ和方法Ⅱ的相对误差分别为16%和13%，且在均匀场和湍流环境中均表现稳健。联合拟合Stokes I和V优于顺序拟合，噪声增加八倍时误差翻倍，光学深度对总不确定性的影响较小。在L1544区域的FAST观测中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Zeeman分析在LOS磁场测量中具有可靠性，方法Ⅰ适用于简单估计，方法Ⅱ则提供更详细的统计信息。联合拟合方法效果更佳，证明了Zeeman技术在基准核心中的适用性。

Abstract: Zeeman observations provide the only direct probe of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields in the interstellar medium. To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/dν to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core.

Conclusion: 气体吸积是BH质量增长至中等质量范围的关键机制，支持相关引力波信号的解释。

Abstract: We review our semi-analytic model of stellar black hole (BH) mass growth by gas accretion in gas-rich stellar clusters during their birthstage within the first $\sim 10\,{\rm Myr}$ after the first stellar formation event. Such proto-stellar clusters are massive and compact, with typical masses $\sim 10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and sizes $\sim 1\,{\rm pc}$, suggested by recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. We find that the BH masses are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the BH mass gap, well within the range of components of the recent gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW231123, and up to masses $\sim 10^3\,{\rm M}_\odot$.

Abstract: Automated characterization of galactic substructure is an essential step in understanding the transformative physical processes driving galaxy evolution. In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning (DL) frameworks to characterize different galactic substructures hosted within parametric light-profile subtracted ``residual'' images of a large sample galaxies from the CANDELS survey. We develop a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and unsupervised Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CvAE) and train it on the single-Sérsic profile fitting based residual images of $10,046$ bright and massive galaxies ($H<24.5\,{\rm mag}$ and $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) spanning $1<z<3$, in conjunction with their visual-based classification labels indicating the nature of residual substructures hosted within them. Using our unique data preprocessing approach, we prepare our residual images such that the inputs to our DL networks comprise only ``galaxy of interest'', and augment them such that our sample span uniformly across different residual characteristics. We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of host galaxies of radio sources within the 1.35$R_{200}$ of the Coma cluster by combining deep 144MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) with optical spectroscopy and photometry from DESI and SDSS. We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium.

Motivation: 研究星系形态序列（如椭圆星系和盘星系的比例随质量的变化）的成因，填补现有理论中对形态序列起源理解的不足。

Method: 通过一个包含并合过程的简单星系演化模型，分析星系质量比例在暗物质晕中的峰值如何影响形态序列的形成。

Result: 高质量星系由于其暗物质晕长期超过峰值质量，在与卫星晕并合时更高效地增加核球质量比例；低质量星系则因相反条件不利于核球增长。AGN和超新星反馈可能是峰值形成的原因。

Conclusion: 星系形态与反馈过程存在紧密关联，暗示需进一步研究其因果关系。

Abstract: Bulges and disks are major structural components that define galaxy morphology. The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架为无缝光谱下的星系特征提取提供了高效方法，显著提升了CSST的科学产出。

Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct wide-field multiband photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys, advancing cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. Achieving CSST's cosmological goals requires precise redshifts ($σ_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim 0.002-0.005$) from low-resolution ($R\sim200$) and potentially blended slitless spectra. We present BayeSED3, extended for Bayesian full-spectrum analysis, including nebular emission modeling (via \textsc{Cloudy}) and a Bayesian treatment of the model scaling factor, improving reliability over optimization methods for low SNR spectra. Validated on realistic mock data generated with the CESS emulator (median SNR=1.65, including instrumental and self-blending effects), our method achieves excellent redshift precision with three-band (GU+GV+GI) spectroscopy: $σ_{\rm NMAD}=0.0008$ ($\sim$80% success) for star-forming and $σ_{\rm NMAD}=0.0015$ ($\sim$50% success) for quiescent galaxies. Stellar mass ($σ_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.015$ dex for SF, $\approx0.016$ dex for quiescent) and SFR ($σ_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.05$ dex for SF, especially at SNR>1) are reliably recovered. Self-blending increases scatter by $\gtrsim30%$, but combining spectroscopy with CSST's seven-band photometry significantly improves accuracy, especially for quiescent galaxies and data-limited cases. Single-band spectroscopy plus photometry yields reasonable redshifts: GU+photometry is limited, GI+photometry gives >60% (SF) and >40% (quiescent) success at $σ_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim0.002$, GV+photometry gives >35% (SF) and $\sim$40% (quiescent) at similar precision. The Bayesian framework offers a powerful method for accurate galaxy characterization, enhancing CSST's scientific outcomes despite the challenges of slitless spectroscopy.

Abstract: The Galactic Centre black hole provides a naive environment for understanding unknown matter distribution and new gravitational physics. For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy.

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are important laboratories for studying cosmic magnetism because they can maintain strong magnetic fields via the action of turbulent dynamo despite their low mass and weak gravitational potential. The Magnetic-field Evolution in Dwarf galaxies from Ultra-deep SKA Analysis (MEDUSA) survey is the first SKA-pathfinder programme designed to obtain deep continuum, polarisation, and HI data for dwarf galaxies, enabling a comprehensive study of their radio spectra, magnetic fields, and gas kinematics across a representative population. By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field. We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis. The integrated spectral energy distribution has a non-thermal spectral index of $α_{\rm nth} = -0.678\pm0.085$. Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $ν_{\rm b} = 6.2\pm1.3$ GHz. In star-forming regions, the magnetic field exhibits strong small-scale fluctuations in RM, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo. Conversely, the field becomes more ordered, aligning with the tidal arms toward the galaxy's outskirts, showing a large-scale magnetic field over $\approx3$ kpc. Observations of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487 show that even low-mass galaxy mergers, likely the building blocks of larger galaxies in the early Universe, can rapidly amplify and produce coherent large-scale magnetic field structures, highlighting their key contribution in the early magnetisation of galaxies.

Abstract: Recent studies show that the Milky Way stellar halo is composed of populations of different origins, shaped by multiple accretion events. To better understand the formation of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, we characterize the chemical and kinematic properties of halo substructures using GALAH DR4 and Gaia data. We apply wavelet transforms in the space of sqrt(J_r) and azimuthal action (L_z) to identify kinematic overdensities. Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin.

Conclusion: TDRG的三重双重结构并非由长期静止期导致，与之前基于运动年龄的研究结果不同，支持更快的核活动周期模型。

Abstract: Triple-double radio galaxies (TDRGs) are amongst the rarest subpopulations of radio galaxies (RGs). They are characterised by three pairs of radio lobes, where each pair of lobes represents an episode of nuclear activity. Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages.

Motivation: 探索开放星团的形态稳定性及其与空间位置和年龄的关系，以理解星团的演化和外部干扰对其形态的影响。

Method: 使用文献中的开放星团目录，定义新参数Ncore/Nouter（核心区与外围区的成员数比值），并分析其与总成员数N的关系，同时比较不同空间位置和年龄段的斜率差异。

Result: Ncore/Nouter与N显著正相关（斜率1.140±0.039），表明核心区密度是更敏感的稳定性指标；径向位置和年龄较大的星团斜率更高，暗示银河系中心引力对其影响更大。

Conclusion: 核心区恒星密度是开放星团形态稳定性的关键指标，其变化受空间位置和年龄显著影响，银河系中心引力和年轻星团的内部动力学加热是主要干扰因素。

Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\pm0.116 and 0.733\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\pm0.110 and 0.529\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751\pm0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442\pm0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo, containing debris from past accretion events, serves as a fossil record of hierarchical mass assembly. Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures.

Abstract: Bars are among the most prominent galactic structures, yet their formation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $θ_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \leq m/M \leq 1/3$), several models yield ``weakening bars'', in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $θ_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis.

TL;DR: 该论文利用基于模拟的先验（SBPs）分析DESI全形状聚类数据，显著增强了ΛCDM宇宙学参数的约束，特别是在物质密度、哈勃常数和质量涨落幅度方面。SBPs还提高了对暗能量和宇宙学常数的限制，提供了迄今为止最强的中微子质量上限约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于通过模拟生成的先验（SBPs）改进对小尺度信息的利用，从而增强对宇宙学参数的约束，特别是在暗能量、中微子质量和HOD模型假设下的敏感性。

Method: 方法包括利用场级模拟生成的HOD模型拟合EFTs参数分布，得到SBPs，并结合DESI DR2的BAO信息和BBN先验进行功率谱分析。

Result: 结果表明SBPs显著提升了ΛCDM参数约束（如Ω_m和H_0），并提供了更强的中微子质量上限（M_ν < 0.090 eV）。暗能量的动力学证据不明显，方程状态参数与宇宙学常数一致。

Conclusion: 结论显示SBPs通过整合小尺度信息显著提升了宇宙学参数约束，尽管结果对HOD模型假设敏感，但证明了该方法在改进宇宙学研究中的潜力。

Abstract: We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $Λ$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $Ω_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\pm 0.018$), which are $1\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $σ_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\%$ ($20\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2σ$ ($1.4σ$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\%$ limits $M_ν<0.073\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_ν<0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管理论上暗物质和气体的边界应重合，但模拟显示它们存在偏移，需进一步研究其统计关系和物理机制。

Method: 使用IllustrisTNG模拟套件分析812个星团质量晕，计算边界的角分布及其与晕特性的相关性，采用基于色散的splashback边界定义和最大熵距离的激波定位。

Result: 观察到splashback和激波边界的偏移（$R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$），偏移主要沿空洞方向；红移较低时边界可能不分离；气体在合并时因能量耗散和压力抵抗收缩导致偏移。

Conclusion: 气体和暗物质边界的偏移由物理机制（如压力效应）和模拟方法决定，激波的压力轮廓特征对叠加方法敏感，这对观测有重要意义。

Abstract: The boundaries of dark matter and gas in clusters are delineated by the splashback radius and the accretion shock, respectively. Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations.

Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis combining full-shape (FS) clustering measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2. To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $Λ$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m = 0.3035 \pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \pm 0.0059$, and $σ_8 = 0.822 \pm 0.034$. For the $w_0 w_a$CDM dynamical dark energy model, we measure $w_0 = 0.49 \pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\sim 30\%$ relative to the analogous DR1 measurement and reducing the discrepancy with $Λ$CDM to $1.4σ$ when compared to BAO only analyses. We also report competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses and spatial curvature. This work demonstrates that the ShapeFit compression provides a prior-robust and computationally efficient pathway to constrain beyond-$Λ$CDM physics with large-scale structure.

Abstract: This work examines the cosmological implications of two functional forms of $f(R,T) = R + αT^n$ gravity: for two different value of $n $ where $n=1$ and $n\neq 1$, and $α$ and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $χ^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $Λ$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $α$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $ω$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $Λ$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.

### [58] [Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19044)
*Takeshi Fukuyama*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 通过分析早期JWST数据中高红移星系和活动星系核的红移分布，发现$\ln(1+z)$中存在周期性结构，可能与BEC宇宙学中的循环凝聚体动力学有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高红移宇宙中是否存在周期性结构，并研究其可能的动力学起源，例如BEC宇宙学中的循环凝聚体行为。

Method: 使用基线校正的无箱频率分析方法，检测$\ln(1+z)$中的周期性峰值。

Result: 发现显著的周期性峰值$\Delta x \simeq 0.34$，与QCD轴子凝聚体内在周期标度一致。

Conclusion: 结果为循环BEC宇宙学作为高红移宇宙中对数周期性结构的动力学起源提供了观测支持。

Abstract: We analyze the redshift distribution of high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable $x=\ln(1+z)$. A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $Δx \simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution.
  A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\ln(1+z)$.
  While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.

Method: 在爱因斯坦框架下，利用解析近似解研究慢滚暴胀时期的标量场运动，推导Ricci标量、Hubble参数等表达式。

Result: Starobinsky模型的$η$值为$(1.05-1.46)\times10^{-11}$，幂律模型为$(1.06-1.53)\times10^{-11}$。$η$值与$M_{\ast}$相关，调整$M_{\ast}$可匹配观测值。

Conclusion: 两种模型的$η$值与观测值接近，表明引力重子生成机制在修正引力理论中可行。幂律模型的参数有待进一步拟合优化。

Abstract: The generation of a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the Universe via gravitational baryogenesis is investigated for two f(R) modified theories of gravity, the widely used Starobinsky $f(R)=R+R^{2}/M^{2}$ model, and the recently proposed power-law model $f(R)=c_{1}R^{2+k/4}+c_{2}R+c_{3}$ of Odintsov and Oikonomou (2025) that is constructed from the slow-roll inflation parameters, and fits the new high-multipole CMB observations reported by the Planck and ACT collaborations for $k \sim -0.03$. The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $η$ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $η$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $η$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $η= 8.65 \times 10^{-11}$. Since $η\propto (M/M_{\ast})^{2}$, reducing $M_{\ast}$ slightly from $M_{Pl}$ to $0.4 M_{Pl}$ would bring the calculated values into agreement with the observed value.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quintessence field with an exponential potential motivated by the suggestion of time-varying dark energy from the DESI galaxy survey. Assuming a kination epoch in the early Universe, we analytically derive constraints on initial conditions that are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the current dark energy density. Compared to the severe 120-digit fine-tuning required for dark energy to be a cosmological constant, our result suggests that the degree of fine-tuning is naturally relaxed by dozens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we discuss the method for testing this model through future observations of the gravitational wave background.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 利用第四阶段CMB和光学巡天的层析交叉相关性（tSZ、星系成团和弱引力透镜）校准流体静力学质量偏差（b_HSE），通过优化的层析分仓（LSST:10个透镜、5个源；CSST:6个透镜、5个源）和多参数边际化，预测SO+LSST、CMB-S4+LSST和CMB-S4+CSST分别获得0.98%、1.60%和2.40%的限制精度，表明层析分析通过打破b_HSE–σ_8简并性显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体静力学质量偏差（b_HSE）是星系团宇宙学中的主要系统误差来源，也是σ_8和Ω_m简并性的关键因素。研究旨在通过第四阶段巡天的多波段层析分析，实现对b_HSE的精确校准。

Method: 采用Fisher预报方法，结合真实巡天噪声、前景模型（CIB和射电源）、全参数边际化（宇宙学、天体物理干扰参数），并利用HMCode2020建模重子反馈。实验中优化层析分仓（LSST:10透镜+5源；CSST:6透镜+5源）。

Result: SO+LSST、CMB-S4+LSST和CMB-S4+CSST的边际化限制精度分别为0.98%、1.60%和2.40%。层析分析提升b_HSE精度约3倍，而仅依赖光学数据无法直接约束b_HSE。

Conclusion: 第四阶段巡天的多波段层析分析能实现对流体静力学质量偏差（b_HSE）的稳健控制，支持基于星系团的结构增长限制研究。

Abstract: The hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) is a leading systematic uncertainty in cluster cosmology and a principal source of degeneracy with $σ_8$ and $Ω_m$. We investigate the capability of Stage-IV CMB and optical surveys to calibrate $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ using tomographic cross-correlations between the thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, galaxy clustering, and weak lensing. We perform a Fisher forecast incorporating realistic survey noise, foreground modeling for clustered CIB and radio sources, and full marginalization over cosmological and astrophysical nuisance parameters, including per-bin galaxy bias perturbations, photometric redshift shifts, intrinsic alignments, and baryonic feedback modeled with HMCode2020. With optimized tomographic binning (10 lens and 5 source bins for LSST; 6 lens and 5 source bins for CSST), we forecast marginalized constraints of $0.98\%$ for SO+LSST, $1.60\%$ for CMB-S4+LSST, and $2.40\%$ for CMB-S4+CSST. Tomography improves $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by factors of approximately three relative to non-tomographic analyses, reflecting the role of redshift information in breaking the $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$--$σ_8$ degeneracy. Optical-only probes provide no direct constraint on $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$, whereas inclusion of tSZ-containing spectra enables percent-level calibration under realistic systematic assumptions. The results demonstrate that multi-probe tomographic analyses with Stage-IV surveys can achieve robust control of hydrostatic mass bias, strengthening cluster-based constraints on structure growth.

Conclusion: 原始黑洞可作为研究修正引力的新探针，Rastall引力对黑洞形成过程的影响显著。

Abstract: Primordial black holes formed in the early universe are compelling candidates for dark matter. We investigate their production in Rastall gravity, a modification of general relativity that introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry through the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity. Our results establish primordial black holes as novel probes of modified gravity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 周期性重复的TDEs为研究部分撕裂与完全撕裂的差异提供了理想实验室，尤其是在X射线亮度快速转变现象上的观测差异。

Method: 通过分析燃料供应减少对TDEs的影响，推导了TDEs盘中爱丁顿比例下降时间的通用表达式，并研究了恒星残骸与盘碰撞产生的X射线耀斑。

Result: 研究发现周期性TDEs的爱丁顿比例转变与X射线双星类似，且光学/UV辐射的平台光度不受燃料减少影响，但X射线耀斑难以观测。

Conclusion: 周期性TDEs的状态转变受燃料供应驱动，光学/UV辐射稳定，X射线耀斑短暂且难以检测。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events which repeat on timescales of months-to-years represent an unambiguous signature of a partial disruption, with the surviving stellar remnant returning to pericentre to be repeatedly stripped by tidal forces. These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\rm edd} = L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm edd} \sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\rm flare} \simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\rm flare} \simeq 0.1-1$ hr).

Abstract: The Forbush decrease (FD) of cosmic rays is an important probe of the interplanetary environment disturbed by solar activities. In this work, we study the properties of 8 FDs electrons (including positrons) between 2 GeV and 20 GeV from January, 2016 to March, 2024, with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer. The maximum decrease amplitudes of these events are about 30% - 15%, and the amplitudes reduce with energy. The recovery time of these events shows diverse behaviors of their energy-dependence. Some of them show strong energy-dependence, while some have a nearly constant recovery time. It has been shown that such diverse behaviors could be related with the geometry of the disturbed regions of the interplanetary space by coronal mass ejections (CME), represented by the combined effect of the CME velocity, angular spread, and ejection direction.

Conclusion: 这是首次在SRGA J144459.2$-$604207中检测到爆发振荡，也是第二次在爆发前观测到振荡现象。

Abstract: Burst oscillations during thermonuclear X-ray bursts are powered by thermonuclear energy on the neutron star (NS) surface and typically occur close to the spin frequency of the NS. We performed a comprehensive timing analysis of all thermonuclear bursts from the newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207, observed with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR during the 2024 outburst. A total of 39 bursts were detected, allowing for a detailed search for burst oscillations, which had not been previously observed from this source. We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 447.7$-$448.0 Hz from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, consistent with the spin frequency of the NS. The strongest burst oscillation in the XMM-Newton data occurred with a single-trial significance of $5.1σ$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\sim31$. In the NuSTAR data, the strongest oscillation signal has a significance of $5.2σ$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\sim32$. The folded pulse profile corresponding to the strongest signal in the 0.5-10 keV band of the XMM-Newton data shows a sinusoidal shape with a fractional rms amplitude of $\sim8.5\%$, while the measurements of the NuSTAR data (3-40 keV range) yield $\sim21\%$. These results represent the first detection of burst oscillations in SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. Additionally, we report the detection of 447.6 Hz oscillations occurring just before a burst onset observed with XMM-Newton. This marks only the second instance in which burst oscillations have been observed before the burst onset.

Motivation: 研究中子星X射线超级爆发（MAXI J1752$-$457）后的冷却机制，探索可能的核Urca过程及其在天体物理中的作用。

Method: 利用日本卫星MAXI和NinjaSat观测中子星超级爆发后的冷却过程，分析温度数据和Urca对的动力学行为。

Result: 观测表明，Urca过程在超级爆发后的2天内主导冷却，暗示了海洋中Urca壳层的存在，最大温度约4 GK。

Conclusion: 核Urca过程可能存在于中子星的海洋层中，为通过长期监测地壳冷却探索超级爆发灰烬提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose that the rapid cooling of the neutron star following its X-ray superburst in MAXI J1752$-$457 over a period of 4 days, observed by two Japanese satellites, MAXI and NinjaSat, is due to enhanced neutrino emission from cycles of electron capture and $β^{-}$ decay involving odd-$A$ nuclei (or Urca pairs) in the ocean. Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\sim4~{\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales.

Abstract: RCW 86 is a supernova remnant whose origin has recently been linked to an off-center explosion within a cavity created by its progenitor star. In the southwestern region, the forward shock is thought to have reached the cavity wall, encountering diverse environmental conditions. We report on the spatially resolved X-ray polarimetric observation of RCW 86 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In the 2--4.5 keV energy band we find no significant detection of polarization. Employing a dedicated background subtraction procedure and Bayesian spectropolarimetric fitting, we derive 99% upper limits on the polarization degree of the synchrotron component: 15% in higher-statistics regions and 30%--40% in lower-statistics regions. These upper limits on the polarization degree in several regions exclude the possibility of a strongly coherent magnetic field down to the subparsec scale, and that of a moderately coherent one on the scale of the synchrotron features as resolved by IXPE. The results indicate that the shocks in the southwestern rim of RCW 86 propagate more slowly than the unshocked ejecta at their locations, yet exceed the measured proper motion speeds. This behavior is consistent with reflected shocks occurring in tenuous regions of the shocked ejecta, distinct from regions that are radio-bright.

Abstract: Observations of X-ray filaments attached to a couple of powerful pulsars suggest escape of TeV electrons and/or positrons (e$^{\pm}$) from pulsar bow shocks into surrounding large scale magnetic fields. These filaments are usually asymmetric with very weak emission from the other side of the main filaments, and no significant spectral variation has been detected across these filaments, implying inefficient energy loss of emitting particles. We develop a Monte Carlo code to simulate particle transport in a large scale magnetic field and apply the model to PSR B2224+4415 (Guitar). It is shown that, with an injection power of a few tens of percent of the pulsar spin down luminosity, TeV e$^{\pm}$ can explain the observed filament properties with a scattering mean free path along the magnetic field comparable to the length of the observed filament. The model predicts a dim diffuse symmetric X-ray background aligned with the filament on a larger scale, whose flux is proportional to the X-ray emitting e$^{\pm}$ energy loss time for a stable e$^{\pm}$ injection power comparable to the luminosity of this diffuse background. Observations with a large field of view and good sensitivity should be able to detect such a component.

Motivation: 探究耀变体光变曲线中的准周期振荡（QPOs）现象，以理解其物理起源或是否为超大质量双黑洞系统的迹象。

Method: 使用Lomb-Scargle周期图和加权小波变换分析Fermi-LAT数据，并进行STL分解去趋势化；采用统计方法和Transformer模型预测未来光变曲线。

Result: 去趋势化增强了QPO信号；除PG 1553+113外，QPO信号为瞬态。预测显示未来QPO信号可能减弱，但新兴源PKS 0139-09的信号可能增强。

Conclusion: QPO信号的瞬态性和未来变化可能反映其物理起源，新兴源的信号增强值得关注，未来数据可验证这些预测。

Abstract: Blazars exhibit variable emission on diverse timescales. Some light curves show signs of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs), which may encode clues regarding the physical processes behind the emission or point to supermassive binary black holes. We analyzed five blazars with previously reported high significance year-long QPOs, applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform methods to Fermi-LAT data up to early 2025. We furthermore examined an additional source (PKS 0139-09), where nascent QPO may be present. As the light curves showed longer term trends, we detrended the data using an STL decomposition, which often revealed a large seasonal component. We find that detrending generally leads to an increase in the strength of the QPO signal. However, except for PG 1553+113, where a clearly persistent QPO signal is present, we detect transience on a timescale of $\lesssim$4000 days. We then forecast the light curves over the following four years, using a traditional statistical method as well as a Transformer-based deep learning model. Applied to a test set, the latter showed significant success in predicting behavior that seems unexpected from simple inspection of the past data. Analyzing the extended time series suggests a markedly weaker QPO signals over the coming years in cases where the transient behavior appears near the end of the observational data. In contrast, in the nascent candidate QPO source (PKS 0139-09) the signal is expected to strengthen significantly. These predictions, which may reflect the physical origin of the QPOs, can be tested against future data.

### [70] [Parameter Estimation Limits in Blazars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19301)
*Agniva Roychowdhury*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文通过Fisher信息方法量化了blazar谱能量分布（SED）中的参数简并性，发现EC模型的信息提取极限远低于SSC模型，且多普勒因子δ是SED中最受约束的参数。应用框架分析了FSRQ的爆发SED，提出时间分辨SED模型对EC主导的blazar物理参数约束至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: blazar SED中的参数简并性问题尚未充分量化，本文旨在通过Fisher信息方法解决这一问题，为物理信息提取提供理论限制。

Method: 通过Fisher信息评估方法，分析SSC和EC模型中δ、B、p、γ_min和γ_max等参数的信息提取极限。同时将该框架应用于CTA 102和3C 279的爆发SED数据。

Result: EC模型的Fisher信息比SSC模型低10^4倍；δ在各参数中信息量最高（10^{2-3}倍）。应用显示δ和p的轻微变化可解释部分爆发SED，但某些爆发无法通过单区模型复现。

Conclusion: EC主导的blazars中参数推断的极限较差，时间分辨SED模型对参数约束至关重要，单区模型在某些情况下效果有限。

Abstract: Parameter degeneracy in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is known but rarely quantified. This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $δ$, $B$, $p$, $γ_{\rm min}$ and $γ_{\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $δ$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $δ$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $δ$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.

Result: 排除异常值后，FRB的最大能量下限范围为$1.2\times10^{41}$至$1.9\times10^{42}$ erg，最佳估计为$1.2\times10^{42}$ erg。结果表明FRB的能量上限可能与磁星的外部偶极磁场能量一致。

Conclusion: 该研究支持磁星作为FRB的起源模型，并为FRB的能量上限提供了新的约束。

Abstract: Quantifying the maximum energy of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can provide stringent constraints on their emission mechanisms and progenitor models. However, the most energetic bursts are rare, requiring a large sample of FRBs to detect them. In this work, we use the largest available such sample, 2,998 one-off FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog, to obtain a lower limit on the maximum energy ($E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$) of FRBs, assuming isotropic energy distribution from FRB sources. In the absence of known redshifts ($z$) for most sources, we present a framework that uses the dispersion measures (DMs) and fluences of these FRBs, together with the probability distribution of $z$ given DM, to derive the lower limit on $E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$. We generate simulated FRB samples assuming different parameter values for a log-normal $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{host}}$ distribution and a Schechter function form of the FRB energy function to estimate how many outliers -- FRBs with large DM contributions from the host galaxy or intervening galaxy halos -- could artificially inflate this limit. After accounting for outliers, the lower limit on $E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ from Catalog 2 FRBs ranges between $1.2\times10^{41}$ and $1.9\times10^{42}$ erg, with best estimate $1.2\times10^{42}$ erg. This limit is consistent with those derived from much smaller FRB samples. Moreover, inferred energies of hundreds of FRBs appear collectively limited around $\sim10^{42}$ erg, suggesting a physical limit on the energy reservoir of FRB sources. The corresponding isotropic-equivalent FRB source energy is consistent with the total energy available in a magnetar's external dipole magnetic field, supporting magnetars as FRB progenitors.

Abstract: We present a multitask surrogate for neutron-star equations of state (EoSs) that delivers \emph{distribution-free}, certified uncertainty via split conformal prediction (CP) and its Mondrian variant. The surrogate ingests a six-parameter piecewise-polytropic representation $(\log_{10}p_1,Γ_1,Γ_2,Γ_3,ρ_1,ρ_2)$ -- with fixed transition densities $ρ_1$ and $ρ_2$ -- and jointly performs (i) validity classification under physical/observational constraints and (ii) regression of $M_{\max}$, $R(M_{\max})$, $R_{1.4}$, and $Λ_{1.4}$. Trained on a balanced set of $40{,}000$ EoSs, the model attains near-perfect discrimination (AUC $\approx 0.997$) and sub-percent relative errors for masses and radii, with few-percent error for tidal deformability. Across $α\in[0.05,0.25]$, empirical coverages closely track $1-α$ for both Standard and Mondrian CP; in conservative regimes, Mondrian yields narrower average physical widths at comparable coverage. To our knowledge, this is the first application of class-conditioned (Mondrian) conformal calibration to neutron-star EoS surrogates, enabling efficient, reproducible, and uncertainty-aware inference; the framework is readily extensible to functional targets (e.g., full $R(M)$ curves).

Abstract: The radio detection of extensive air showers provides a powerful method for studying the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) offers unprecedentedly detailed measurements of the radio emission footprint. However, fully exploiting this information requires advanced reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for air shower reconstruction based on Bayesian inference and Information Field Theory (IFT). Our method is built on a fully differentiable forward model of the radio signal, which incorporates a physical emission parameterization and a precise wavefront model. Additionally, we augment this physical model with Gaussian processes to account for systematic uncertainties in both the signal fluence and arrival timing. By leveraging gradient information, our approach enables efficient (three orders of magnitude acceleration w.r.t.\ the legacy method) and robust inference of the underlying physical shower parameters, such as primary energy and the depth of shower maximum, $X_\text{max}$. This work provides not only point estimates but also a rigorous quantification of uncertainties. We achieve a resolution in $X_\text{max}$ of $25\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ and a radiation energy resolution of $12\%$ on simulations for LOFAR.

Abstract: Understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme densities is a central problem in fundamental physics, but neutron star mergers provide a natural laboratory for probing this regime. However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

Abstract: There is still much debate around the inner workings of the GRB prompt emission phase with many questions still left unanswered. Polarization signatures offer a promising new avenue to discriminate between the various GRB prompt emission models. The aim of this study is to estimate energy and time resolved polarization signatures resulting from Inverse Compton (IC) scattering for two specific GRB prompt emission models, namely the backscatter-dominated cork model by \citet{Vyas2} and a Compton drag model by \citet{Lazzati2}. In order to achieve this we apply an IC polarization Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to those two GRB models in order to estimate the expected polarization signatures. For the backscatter-dominated cork model we find polarization signatures below $\sim 10$~\%, likely below the detection limits of current or near-future X-ray and $γ$-ray polarimeters. Our results for the Compton drag model indicates polarization results consistent with that found by \citet{Lazzati3}. Furthermore, we find some energy and time dependence of the estimated polarization, particularly for the polarization angle.

Result: 计算出轨道周期为0.153天，光谱显示电离随时间增加；Hα线剖面表明双极形态，存在极斑和赤道环；爆发19.87天后检测到[Ne III]和[Ne V]线，147.66天后仍存在星云线。

Abstract: We present the evolution of optical spectra and lightcurves of the fast nova V1674 Herculis during 150 days past its eruption. Using the post-eruption AAVSO light curve, we have calculated the orbital period of V1674 Her to be 0.153 days. There is no unambiguous white dwarf spin period in our data. The optical spectra show that the ionisation increases with time. A morpho-kinematic analysis of the H$α$ line profile indicates a bipolar morphology with polar blobs and an equatorial ring. Lyman beta fluorescence is found to be the dominant mechanism for the excitation of neutral oxygen. On day 19.87, [Ne III] & [Ne V] lines are present, indicating the presence of the ONe white dwarf. On day 147.66, the nebular lines are still present, implying that the nova had not gone into quiescence yet; this spectrum is accretion-dominated.

Abstract: We argue that all dynamical astrophysical black hole merger channels are expected to result in a common eccentricity distribution at gravitational wave (GW) frequencies relevant for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) in the high eccentricity limit. This follows from the large separation of scales between the GW regime required for creating eccentric mergers in LVK, and the underlying astrophysical formation environment. Our analytical solution shows exceptional agreement with numerical studies. This finding has important implications for both theoretical studies and ongoing searches for eccentric GW sources.

Abstract: High-energy multimessenger background analyses over the past decade have provided evidence for a population of hidden neutrino sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma rays, a picture bolstered by recent observations of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. The coronal regions in the hearts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as the most promising sites for such hidden nonthermal particle production, and NGC 1068 is expected to be the most neutrino-active galaxy for IceCube. We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs.
