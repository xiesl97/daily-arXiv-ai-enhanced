Proceedings of Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Goerlitz, 2025", "summary": "The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) curates all observational data acquired at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The archive is expected to grow rapidly as complex new instruments are commissioned and as the expectations of archive users have expanded. In response, KOA has implemented a new Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure. This work is a continuation of the architectural design and technology selection identified at ADASS 2024. We have deployed real-time ingestion of newly acquired data and a dedicated interface for observers to manage these data. Our ADASS 2024 poster identified the new technologies chosen: Plotly-Dash, a low-code framework that exploits event-driven callbacks to simplify the handling of user interactions; R-tree spatial indexing to speed up spatial searches by x20; a VO-compliant TAP middleware, already in use at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and NEID archive; and mViewer, a visualization engine in the Montage Image Mosaic toolkit that is optimized for astronomy images.\n  These technologies will underpin new services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks, and when completed, will replace the current query infrastructure. We have completed two new services now in beta release. The first is the Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns spatial and temporal queries of the entire archive in seconds. It supports filtering observations by keywords, previewing results in an interactive data grid, and visualizing images, and it offers data downloads. The second is a Jupyter notebook that performs interactive visualization of Keck observations of protostars in the Rho Oph Dark Cloud and uses data from CDS and IRSA, as well as KOA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Keck\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u6863\u6848\uff08KOA\uff09\u7684\u65b0Python\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528VO\u517c\u5bb9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecPlotly-Dash\u3001R-tree\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u548cmViewer\u7b49\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cKOA\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "KOA\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Python\u5f00\u53d1\u7684VO\u517c\u5bb9\u67e5\u8be2\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Plotly-Dash\u3001R-tree\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u548cTAP\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6444\u53d6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5df2\u63a8\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u670d\u52a1\u548cJupyter\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9010\u6b65\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $\u03b1=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $\u03b1=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u90bb\u8fd1Hydra I\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\uff08GCs\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea2\u84ddGCs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ea2GCs\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u7cfb\u5468\u56f4\uff0c\u84ddGCs\u5219\u66f4\u5ef6\u4f38\u5e76\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6c14\u4f53\u5cf0\u503c\u91cd\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528GCs\u7684\u7279\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u661f\u7cfb\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548cICL\u56e0\u6781\u6697\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0cGCs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u793a\u8e2a\u7269\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7GCs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u7279\u6027\u63ed\u793aHydra I\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7684\u7ec4\u88c5\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLT/FORS\u6df1\u573aV\u548cI\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VI\u989c\u8272-\u661f\u7b49\u56fe\u7b5b\u9009GC\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u7ea2\u84dd\u4e9a\u7fa4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGCs\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u7ea2GCs\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u7cfbNGC 3311\u548cNGC 3309\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u84ddGCs\u5219\u5ef6\u4f38\u5e76\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6c14\u4f53\u5cf0\u503c\u91cd\u5408\u3002\u84ddGCs\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u5728ICL\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5916\u56f4\u533a\u57df\u6bd4\u7ea2GCs\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5185\u533a\u9ad8\u7ea65\u500d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7GCs\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u663e\u793a\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u6697\u7aef\u659c\u7387\u66f4\u9661\u3002", "conclusion": "GCs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u989c\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Hydra I\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7684\u7ec4\u88c5\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u84ddGCs\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u5265\u79bb\u6216\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u74e6\u89e3\uff0c\u7ea2GCs\u5219\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u7cfb\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

We argue that the critique conflates object-level validation with ensemble-level statistical inference and relies on a reduced, heterogeneously filtered subset originally constructed for a different scientific purpose. We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al.

For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \\in [50,170] \\,\\rm \u03bceV$ and set $g_{a \u03b3} \\lesssim 10^{-11}\\rm \\,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions.

This is the slowest spinning pulsar known in this globular cluster, and has a $\\sim1.67$-day orbit with an eccentricity of $e\\approx0.18$. Although it was not yet possible to derive an unambiguous phase-connected timing solution, by combining detections obtained from MeerKAT and archival Parkes data we were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron to high significance, $\\dot\u03c9$ = 0.1601 $\\pm 0.0046$ deg yr$^{-1}$. This value implies a total system mass of $2.41 \\pm 0.11\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ (68.3\\% C. L.), which, when combined with the binary mass function, gives a maximum pulsar mass of $\\sim 1.7 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and a minimum companion mass of $\\sim 0.7\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Apart from being the slowest pulsar in 47~Tucanae, its orbit is by far the most eccentric and its companion is the most massive among all known binary pulsars in this globular cluster. One possibility is that system is an old MSP - Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf binary, whose orbit was perturbed by stellar dynamical interactions in the cluster core.

Open source code and data available at https://gitlab.com/astrogal/mocklss", "summary": "Current observational and simulated large-scale structure (LSS) catalogues often lack consistency in assigning galaxies to specific structures, due to the absence of a universally accepted classification criterion. With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08LSS\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08LSS\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u5f55\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aLSS\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Voronoi\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86LSS\u4e2d\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDSS\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5339\u914d\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u76ee\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620LSS\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ecMalmquist\u504f\u5dee\u548cGod\u624b\u6307\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eLSS\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684LSS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions. This work can also be extrapolated to other existing 8-10 m class telescopes, or even future 30-40 m class telescopes, where the use of FPWFS can significantly improve sky coverage and reduce the lag error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eKeck I\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\uff08FPWFS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u94a0\u5c42\u6162\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8Gerchberg-Saxton\uff08GS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u5149\u5bfc\u5f15\u661f\uff08LGS\uff09\u5728\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5929\u7a7a\u8986\u76d6\u9650\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u94a0\u5c42\u7684\u6162\u901f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6162\u7126\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u5f15\u661f\uff08NGS\uff09\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5929\u7a7a\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cdFPWFS\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3NGS\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9891\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdFPWFS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aGerchberg-Saxton\uff08GS\uff09\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6280\u672f\uff08LiFT\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u62df\u5408\uff08Gf\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c2025\u5e74Keck\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53f0\u548c\u5929\u7a7a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "GS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8865\u507f\u4e86\u4eba\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u6e4d\u6d41\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GS\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u672a\u6765\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e8-10\u7c73\u7ea7\u6216\u672a\u676530-40\u7c73\u7ea7\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5929\u7a7a\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ede\u540e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TDE\u78c1\u76d8\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u77ed\u6682\u7d2b\u5916\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u77ac\u53d8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0e\u665a\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76TDE\uff08\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u665a\u671f\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf/\u5149\u5b66\u77ac\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7d2b\u5916\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u77ac\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982Zwicky Transient Facility\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51fa\u77ed\u65f6\uff08\u5929\uff09\u7d2b\u5916\u4eae\u53d8\uff0c\u5149\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a10^42-10^43 erg/s\uff08\u8fd1\u7d2b\u5916\uff09\u548c10^41-10^42 erg/s\uff08\u5149\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u77ac\u53d8\u9891\u7387\u4e3a1-2\u6b21/\u5e74\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7efc\u5408\u7d2b\u5916/\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1TDE\u70ed\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u665a\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure.

PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8ePoint Spread Function\uff08PSF\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5PIFF\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684PSF\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684PIFF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PSF\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9Subaru\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684HSC\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u6052\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0PSF\u5728\u5168\u89c6\u573a\u5185\u7684\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6355\u83b7\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684PSF\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a$3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8ePIFF\u7684$3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aPSF\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLSST\u79d1\u5b66\u7ba1\u9053\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements.

This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\\mathrm{10Hz}\\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f6e\u6c50\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fg\u6a21\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\u504f\u5fc3\u5ea6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3ag\u6a21\u6f6e\u6c50\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684g\u6a21\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6f6e\u6c50\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u661f\u4f53\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u6f6e\u6c50\u573a\u7684\u5f31\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5f3ag\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dg\u6a21\u6f6e\u6c50\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u504f\u5fc3\u8c10\u6ce2\u5728\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u654f\u611f\u9891\u5e26\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86g\u6a21\u6f6e\u6c50\u5728\u504f\u5fc3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u73af\u7ed5\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u504f\u5fc3\u5ea6\uff08$e_\\mathrm{10Hz}\\sim0.2-0.4$\uff09\u53ef\u4f7fg\u6a21\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f6e\u6c50\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u5bf9g\u6a21\u7279\u6027\u65bd\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6709\u671b\u7ea6\u675f\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u662f\u589e\u5f3ag\u6a21\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f6e\u6c50\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The resulting Lagrangian yields a stable scaling attractor where the three-form energy density tracks the dominant background fluid.

This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near \u00c5dalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball.

The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9G292.0+1.8\u7684\u6c27\u5bcc\u96c6\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u80fd\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5e74\u8f7b\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002G292.0+1.8\u662f\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6c27\u5bcc\u96c6\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u788e\u7247\u8f83\u4e3a\u7eaf\u51c0\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CTIO\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8693\u4e2a\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8282\u672a\u51cf\u901f\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff09\uff0c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u5e94\u4e0e\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u65ad\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u80fd\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8282\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u53cc\u9525\u5f62\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5bbd\u9614\u7684\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u55b7\u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u5e74\u8f7b\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "G292.0+1.8\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u80fd\u5b66\u652f\u6301\u5bbd\u9614\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e74\u8f7b\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5fae\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff08CMB\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u504f\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u65f6\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u5b87\u5b99\u5728CMB\u4e2d\u7559\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u62d3\u6251\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684CMB\u6e29\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u6d4b\u62d3\u6251\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528CatBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9CMB\u8c10\u6ce2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u5728CMB\u6e29\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89d2\u4e0a\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u504f\u79bb\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u6291\u5236\u62d3\u6251\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528CMB\u8fdb\u884c\u5b87\u5b99\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5065\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative.

Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\u03b3$-rays and neutrinos.\n  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\u03b3\u03b3$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\u03b3$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.\n  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91caNGC 1068\u548cNGC 7469\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AGN\u5195\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91caSeyfert-\u661f\u66b4\u590d\u5408\u661f\u7cfbNGC 1068\u548cNGC 7469\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u590d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u6269\u6563\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Markov Chain Monte Carlo\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86NGC 1068\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46NGC 7469\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aAGN\u5195\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u5195\u533a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u975e\u552f\u4e00\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4ee5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering.

All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\u03a3$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\u03a3$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized.

Using the multizone framework -- designed to capture bidirectional inflow--outflow from the event horizon to the Bondi scale -- we present a suite of long-duration GRMHD simulations spanning BH spins $|a_\\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\\times10^2$--$2\\times10^6$. From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\\rm Edd}\\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\\dot M(R_B,a_\\ast)$ and feedback power $\\dot E_{\\rm fb}(R_B,a_\\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\u03b7$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\\ast)\\simeq -3.7\\,a_\\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\\rm Edd})\\,{\\rm Gyr}$. Thus, BH spins are effectively frozen during phases of quiescent accretion.

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales.

We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes.\n  Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K.

This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star \"starring\" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called \"arm-crossing companion formation\" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u683c\u5b50\uff08CML\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u6c14\u4f53\u56e2\u5757\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u3001\u76d8\u9762\u3001\u65cb\u81c2\u548c\u4f34\u661f\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u5929\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d8\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6052\u661f\u5f15\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u6c14\u4f53\u629b\u5c04\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b27\u62c9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u4f53\u56e2\u5757\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u5f62\u6210\uff08\u5f15\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u4f53\u56e2\u5757\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\uff08\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u5e73\u6d41\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6052\u661f\u3001\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u76d8\u3001\u65cb\u81c2\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u4f34\u661f\u5929\u4f53\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u81c2\u4ea4\u53c9\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\"\u65cb\u81c2\u4ea4\u53c9\u4f34\u661f\u5f62\u6210\"\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u5f84\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\u5c4f\u969c\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $<$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\u03c3$ occurrence rate upper limit of $<$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $<$10 days, is lower than the $<$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $<$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $<$8 days is below the $<$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\u03b7_{extragalactic}$ $\\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin.

Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff > 6000 K) and cool (Teff < 6000 K) populations. Cross-matching with Gaia DR3, we find that 47.7% of our barium stars within 1 kpc have elevated re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE >= 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE < 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] < -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94a1\u661f\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u6216\u8f90\u5c04\u6d6e\u529b\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u94a1\u661f\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9650\u5236AGB\u6052\u661f\u6838\u5408\u6210\u3001\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u9762\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GALAH\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u7ea6450,000\u9897\u6052\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fd13000\u9897\u65b0\u7684\u5bcc\u94a1\u661f\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u70ed\u548c\u51b7\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Gaia DR3\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u591a\u661f\u6027\u3002", "result": "47.7%\u7684\u8fd1\u57df\u94a1\u661f\u663e\u793a\u9ad8RUWE\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u70ed\u94a1\u661f\u7684\u4f4eRUWE\u503c\u548c\u4f4e\u03b1\u4e30\u5ea6\u652f\u6301\u8f90\u5c04\u6d6e\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u94a1\u661f\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u8584\u76d8\u3001\u539a\u76d8\u548c\u6655\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u6d6e\u529b\u5171\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u94a1\u661f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}
