A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al.

All rings\nlie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly\nthe 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in\nat least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius,\nadding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the\ndynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the\nnon-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin\nchanges of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying\nkey parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to\nresonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been\nobserved. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a\ncentral spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled\nby adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links\nthe body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of\nthe test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally\nassuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between\nnon-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that\nslowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the\nSORs outward, enabling resonant capture.

The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent\nvariables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification\naccuracy of $\\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\\sim$69% when\nrestricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,\nlatent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,\nsuggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant\ninformation. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the\nrepresentation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent\nspace that supports both classification and the estimation of physical\nproperties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral\nstudies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data."}

A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic\nobservations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic\nwaves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative\ninterior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the\nsuppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of\nhigh-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows\nthat core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by\nrefracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at\nmagnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric\ncase, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of\nAlfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior\nwith uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic\nfield. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the\nvertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that\nIGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and\nproduce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric\ncase), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the\nbackground magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid\ndamping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and\nnon-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field."}

Yet, these low-mass\nstars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary\natmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a\nrelatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to\nits Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether\na habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV\nflux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios -\none analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like\nenvironment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate\nthat all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water\non the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ\nsubstantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the\nArchean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under\nintensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the\nsurface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the\ndetection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances\nthe overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth,\npotentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings\nunderscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature\ndetection and a potential protection of surface habitability."}

It is also\ncrucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis\nsingularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break\nflux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant\ndrifts in conserved quantities.

In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a\nfunction of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models,\nand these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately\nestimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations\nthat account for the disk structure. We present the relations between\nluminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer\nmodels with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density\nstructures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model\n(Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between\nthe water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging\n0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a *\n(L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while\nthe power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes\ndenser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity,\nsince dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of\nviscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the\nwater snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a\nand decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect\nof viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the\neffect.

To\nbetter understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study\ntheir physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to\ncharacterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within\nthe Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to\nthe young stellar object (YSO).

Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine\nstructure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new\nself-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the\nnon-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those\nmolecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled\nus to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk}\nsystem's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of\n$\\geq(4.67-18.3)\\times10^{-3}$ $M_\\odot$ (i.e., $\\geq0.65-2.57$ times the\ncurrent disk mass) and an infall rate of $\\geq(1.94-7.57)\\times10^{-7}$\n$M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular\ntracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I\nobjects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer\nmaterial.

Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies\nhave investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our\nmain goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with\nmoderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in\nobservations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed\nin earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at\ncomparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the\nliterature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure\nin our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649\naligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a\njet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we\nfound that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial\nscales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas\npresent small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that\nthe kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by\noutflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and\nionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic\nconsiderations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a\nsignificant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low\nredshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot\nrule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the\ninterstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are\noften assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very\nsmall. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells,\nwhich are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield\nresults that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to\nextrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory\nmodels and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be\nobtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling\ninstead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of\nBoussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this\nset-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal'\nproperties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the\nconvective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde\nequatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective\nRossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties\nis regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the\nconvective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are\ndiffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a\ndiffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations\nthat are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large\nscales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are\nobtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are\ndiffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic\nstellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free\nregimes."}

Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust\ngrains with size ranging from $0.01~\\mu$m to about $0.3~\\mu$m and mass in the\nrange $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and\ndiffuse emission in the $100\\,\\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite\n(IRAS). Then, we estimated the temperature asymmetry induced by the rotation of\nthe M 31 halo and compared the obtained values with the \\textit{Planck}'s\nSMICA-processed data. We find that the AME cannot account for the measured CMB\ntemperature asymmetry, with its contribution constrained to $\\lesssim 7\\%$,\nthereby indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for\nthe observed signal."}

NASA has established\nseveral science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that\n>40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that\nthe GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science."}

Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the\nactivity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of\nthe host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of\noutflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately\nconstant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm\ntr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven\noutflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to\nexpand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical\ncode to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a\nconstant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite\nbulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free\nparameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,\nvariations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of\noutflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles\nessentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density\nprofile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves\nthe fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they\naccelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of\nsignificant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of\noutflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can\nexplain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The\nfree parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable\nranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the\ntrue conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are\noften assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very\nsmall. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells,\nwhich are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield\nresults that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to\nextrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory\nmodels and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be\nobtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling\ninstead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of\nBoussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this\nset-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal'\nproperties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the\nconvective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde\nequatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective\nRossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties\nis regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the\nconvective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are\ndiffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a\ndiffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations\nthat are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large\nscales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are\nobtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are\ndiffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic\nstellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free\nregimes."}

Methods: We took\nspectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young\nclusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec.\nThese spectra were analyzed for H{\\alpha} emission and lithium absorption,\nfeatures indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS\nevolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3\nvariability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis\nof cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos\nof YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution.\nResults: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for\nCollinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate\nkinematic \"traceback ages\" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to\nisochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We\nfind for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their\nisochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr\nbefore their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for\nCollinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies\nmany of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to\noverestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S\nclusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been\ngradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of\nunbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95\nlikely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since\ngas expulsion."}

By combining\nprecise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and\nmeasurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines.\nOur analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around\nsolar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies.\nWe also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr,\nindicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained\nby the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more\nefficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher\nphosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters\nyounger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly\nhinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass\nstars.

We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\\rm ISM}\n\\gtrsim r_{\\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition\n($r_{\\rm cl} > r_{\\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across\ndiverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\\rm cl}/r_{\\rm\ncrit} \\sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the\ninitial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum\nfollowing Zipf's law ($\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}m \\propto m^{-2}$), implying that\nturbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase\noutflows.

To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that\n>40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that\nthe GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science."}

X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show\ndramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The\npower spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law\nthat decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high\nfrequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the\nmass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the\n`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly\nsampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous\npaper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power\nlaw power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56\nvariable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the\n$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends\nin 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We\nalso find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2.

We focus on the FS scenario with\nnon-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are\nexplored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a\nGalactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance\nof 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early\ntimes and a rapid decrease at late times.
