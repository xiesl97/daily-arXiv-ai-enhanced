Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法研究了S2星围绕人马座A*轨道的后验概率分布，对比了七种非旋转黑洞时空解，结果显示现有数据未表现出显著偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在利用最新的S2星轨道观测数据，对比不同黑洞时空理论的参数约束能力，以检验广义相对论及其扩展理论的预测一致性。

Method: 使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法生成后验分布，结合S2星的测光、光谱及近心点进动数据，对各黑洞模型进行贝叶斯比较。

Result: Bardeen和Yukawa类模型与Schwarzschild解在当前不确定性范围内无法区分；其他模型仅显示弱证据，无统计学显著性差异。

Conclusion: 现有观测数据不足以区分所研究的黑洞时空解，表明需更多或更精确的数据以进一步约束理论模型。

Abstract: We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the S2 star orbit around Sagittarius A*, for seven representative non-rotating black hole space-time solutions. In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.

TL;DR: 论文通过数值模拟研究了MACS J0018.5+1626的射电辐射，发现其处于双星团合并状态，并可能解释了LOFAR观测到的射电晕现象。

Motivation: 研究MACS J0018.5+1626的射电辐射，验证ICM-SHOX项目在合并星团动力学中的应用，并探索射电晕的起源。

Method: 结合X射线、SZ效应、光学和透镜观测数据，进行三维磁流体动力学模拟，建模射电辐射并探索初始条件的变化。

Result: 模拟显示合并产生两个典型平均马赫数为2-3的冲击波，可能解释LOFAR观测到的射电晕为两个近乎正面视角的射电遗迹叠加。

Conclusion: 标准扩散冲击加速机制在特定条件下可以解释LOFAR观测结果，射电晕可能由合并驱动的双遗迹叠加引起。

Abstract: We present the first detailed numerical modeling of the radio emission from MACS J0018.5+1626 as part of the Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX) project. By matching X-ray, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich, optical and lensing observables to simulations, the ICM-SHOX pipeline indicates that MACS J0018.5+1626 is undergoing a binary merger close to pericenter passage and is observed along a line of sight nearly aligned with the merger axis. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary cluster mergers coupled to tracer particles and a Fokker--Planck solver to model the radio emission. Exploring variations in the most likely initial conditions within the ICM-SHOX parameter space, such as the relative cluster velocity and impact parameter, we find that the resulting merger configuration consistently produces two merger-driven shocks with typical average Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_s \sim 2$--$3$ with corresponding standard deviations of $σ_{\mathcal{M}} \sim 0.5$--$1.5$. Within this framework, we examine the cluster conditions under which standard diffusive shock acceleration can reproduce LOFAR observations. In particular, we discuss the possibility that the apparent radio halo seen by LOFAR arises from the superposition of two radio relics viewed nearly face-on.

Abstract: Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.

Abstract: Among thousands of extragalactic $γ$-ray emitters, only a handful of distant ($z >$ 3) sources are detected, yet they are cruial probes shedding light on the cosmic evolution of jets of active galactic nuclei and the initial phase of mass growth of supermassive black holes. Here, we report on a multi-band study of a radio quasar B3 1239+376 with $z$ = 3.82. By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$σ$) $γ$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $γ$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $γ$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time. The temporal coincidence establishes a firm association relationship between the $γ$-ray source and the quasar. Therefore, B3 1239+376 is proposed as the {\it third} most distant $γ$-ray-emitting blazar to date. Benefiting from the multi-wavelength observations, broadband spectral energy distributions in different flux states are drawn and reproduced by the classic one-zone leptonic radiation model to investigate the jet properties. Considering the recent brightening in $γ$ rays, prompt follow-up observations are encouraged, especially radio interferometry observations which may catch the potential ejection of a new jet blob.

### [5] [An Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock Model for Long GRBs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05278)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock模型（AMIS），用于解释长伽马射线暴（GRB）瞬发辐射的观测特性。

Method: 通过时间依赖的质量供应历史调节瞬发辐射的外包络，内部激波产生快速变化，重点关注单FRED轮廓的最简单情况。

Conclusion: AMIS模型为研究内引擎活动提供了诊断工具，未来将探索多事件和相互作用激波的复杂情况。

Abstract: We introduce the Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock model (AMIS) as a possible framework for explaining the observational properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\dot{M}\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity.

Conclusion: 光学与高能辐射的不同行为表明其物理起源不同，双暴结构可通过反向激波和正向激波机制解释，并成功约束了喷流参数。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $γ$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $γ$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $γ$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $Γ_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $θ_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.

Result: 发现15个GRB符合BZ机制，22个支持NDAF机制；多数事件斜率介于2至4之间，表明机制可能存在混合或NDAF占主导。

Conclusion: 衰减斜率（参数d）可用于区分中心引擎机制，但多数GRB表现出混合特征，NDAF机制可能更占主导地位。

Abstract: Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.

Conclusion: 高质量多波段数据集结合特征光变曲线分析可有效区分耀变体耀变的主导物理机制。

Abstract: The study of multiwavelength flux and spectral variations during rapid flares from blazars provides strong constraints on the physical parameters of the compact emission regions responsible for these still poorly understood events. Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of "hard-sphere" scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets. This is illustrated with a simplified application to a flare event from the blazar Mrk 421.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to infer the mass of clusters that host hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected with gravitational-waves (GWs), on a single event basis. We show that the requirement that a second-generation (2G) remnant be retained, and subsequently undergo a dynamical encounter, places strong constraints on the mass of the cluster. Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis. We find that these are consistent with either heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters, with inferred masses spanning $10^{5.7 - 7.7} M_{\odot}$ at $68\%$ confidence depending on the 2G recoil velocity distribution used.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter αsystematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing α, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $α$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.

Motivation: 研究目的是通过长期观测数据，精确测量年轻相对论性双星PSR J1906+0746的轨道动力学参数，验证广义相对论的预测，并探索其伴星的性质。

Method: 使用六个射电望远镜（Arecibo、FAST、Green Bank、Lovell、MeerKAT和Nançay）的18年观测数据，结合连贯的时序分析，测量了轨道参数（如近星点进动率、爱因斯坦延迟和轨道周期变化）。

Conclusion: 研究支持广义相对论的预测，同时提出了PSR J1906+0746伴星为白矮星的可能性。未来需进一步验证自旋-轨道耦合信号的性质。

Abstract: We conducted a timing analysis of over 18 years of data on the young ($τ_{\rm c} = 112$ kyr, $P = 114$\,ms) relativistic binary PSR~J1906+0746, using six radio telescopes: Arecibo, FAST, Green Bank, Lovell, MeerKAT, and Nançay. This pulsar is known to orbit a compact high-mass companion with a period of 3.98\,hrs in a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.085$). By combining all data and maintaining a coherent timing solution over the full span, we obtained a more precise measurement of the advance of periastron, $\dotω = 7.5841(2)$\,$°$\,yr$^{-1}$, the Einstein delay, $γ= 4.59(2) \times 10^{-4}$\,s, and the secular change in orbital period, $\dot{P}_{\rm b} = -5.65(2) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. Assuming the validity of general relativity, we obtain a total mass of 2.6133(1)\,$M_{\odot}$ and component masses of 1.316(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and 1.297(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the companion, consistent with a double neutron star system. However, when fitting for the secular change in the projected semi-major axis we obtain $\dot{x} = -1.8(6) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$, the component masses are shifted by $\sim 3.5σ$, which is expected from the correlation of $\dot{x}$ and $γ$. The $\dot{x}$ has a similar magnitude to that observed in PSR~J1141$-$6545, which is due to spin-orbit coupling; if confirmed, it would indicate that, as in the latter system, the companion of the PSR~J1906+0746 system is a massive fast-rotating white dwarf formed before the pulsar. Additionally, we report and characterize a large glitch near MJD 56664, with a fractional frequency increase comparable to those observed in the Vela pulsar.

Abstract: Studying the cross-correlation function between the soft and hard X-ray emission in Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binaries provides crucial insight into the structure and dynamics of the innermost accretion regions. In this work, we investigate the CCF of the Z-source GX 349+2 using an XMM-Newton observation. We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer. We show that the observed lags could also be associated with the depletion timescale of the boundary layer with low viscosity.

### [13] [Complex hydrogen chemical equilibrium and Gaia low mass problem in cool white dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04995)
*Piotr M. Kowalski*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 研究发现Gaia大量数据中冷白矮星的观测值与模型存在显著不匹配，尤其是质量低估。通过抑制H3+形成，模型与观测结果达成一致，表明现有化学平衡模型需重新考虑H3+和其他电荷物种的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷白矮星（Teff <6000 K）的模型与Gaia观测数据之间存在显著差异，尤其是质量被严重低估，这促使研究者探究模型背后的潜在问题。

Method: 应用最先进的大气模型分析Gaia DR3白矮星样本，并通过量子力学计算量化这些恒星大气中不同氢物种的形成和稳定性。实验通过人为抑制H3+形成来验证模型改进的效果。

Result: 抑制H3+形成后，化学平衡被修正，氢原子电离成为自由电子的主要来源，模型成功再现了Gaia观测到的白矮星冷却分支。这表明H3+的丰度或其相关电荷物种的计算可能存在问题。

Conclusion: 冷氢大气白矮星的化学平衡模型需重新评估，特别是H3+物种的丰度和未考虑的其他电荷物种的影响。

Abstract: Large Gaia data set shows substantial misfit between models and observation for cool white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}<6000\,\rm K$, resulting in severe underestimation of masses of these stars.
  We aim to understand the underlying modelling issues.
  State of the art atmosphere models have been applied to analyse the Gaia DR3 sample of white dwarfs as well as quantum mechanical calculations to quantify formation and stability of different hydrogen species in the atmospheres of these stars.
  We reconcile the models and observations when we artificially suppress formation of $\rm H_3^+$ species, a process which substantially alters the chemical equilibrium at $T_{\rm eff}<6000\,\rm K$, resulting in an overabundance of free electrons and $\rm H^-$, and strengthening of $\rm H^-$ bound-free absorption. Removing the $\rm H_3^+$ species from chemical equilibrium consideration makes ionization of hydrogen atoms the main source of free electrons, with the resulting models reproducing well the Gaia white dwarfs cooling branch. Because $\rm H_3^+$ must form under the considered conditions, likely it is the overestimation of its partition function and resulting abundance or the formation of $\rm H_3^-$ or another anionic species that suppresses the formation of $\rm H^-$ as a countercharge for $\rm H_3^+$ in current models.
  Chemical equilibrium in cool, hydrogen atmospheres white dwarfs must be reconsidered in respect to the abundance of $\rm H_3^+$ species and presence of unaccounted charge species.

Abstract: Long-period binary systems containing a B-type hot subdwarf (sdB) and a main-sequence companion are thought to originate from binary interactions involving stable mass transfer from the red giant, the progenitor of the sdB, to the MS companion. However, despite the recent progress in modelling their population, some of their observed properties are not entirely understood. Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了2022-10-02 X1.1级太阳耀斑的微波数据，验证了磁场的演化过程，并发现日冕磁场在耀斑上升阶段显著衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳耀斑通常与磁场拓扑结构的重构相关，但关于磁场演化的观测数据非常有限。因此，需要验证其他耀斑是否也发生类似的磁场演化。

Method: 通过微波数据绘制了耀斑源的磁场分布，并跟踪了耀斑过程中的磁场演化。还开发了3D耀斑模型，对比微波数据推断的磁场。

Result: 观测结果显示日冕磁场在多个环顶位置以高达$10\ G\ s^{-1}$的速率衰减，同时磁场在环腿和喷发暗丝的底部也被测到。电子加速现象显著出现在磁场衰减的区域。3D模型的磁场与微波数据推断的磁场有相似和偏差。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了日冕磁场在耀斑上升阶段会发生衰减，释放的磁能足以支持耀斑的其他能量组分。

Abstract: Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.

TL;DR: 对27个短周期接触双星系统的光变曲线进行了全面分析，使用TESS和ASAS-SN数据，通过BSN应用和MCMC细化得到系统参数和星斑配置。结果表明5个系统为A亚型，其余为W亚型。进一步分析了484个W UMa接触双星，识别区分亚型的参数，并研究了系统的演化状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前尚未对27个短周期接触双星系统进行光变曲线分析，本研究填补了这一空白，并探讨其物理特性和演化状态。

Method: 使用TESS和ASAS-SN数据，通过BSN应用分析光变曲线，结合MCMC方法细化模型参数，引入星斑配置处理O'Connell效应。随后利用轨道周期与半长轴的经验关系推导绝对参数，并通过t统计区分A/W亚型。

Result: 27个系统中5个为A亚型，其余为W亚型；3个系统质量比极低但动力学稳定。低质量伴星通常更演化，主星则较不演化。系统的位置与经验关系图线性拟合一致。

Conclusion: 研究为短周期接触双星系统提供了新的参数和演化线索，验证了经验关系的适用性，并区分了A/W亚型的关键参数。

Abstract: We performed a comprehensive analysis of 27 short period contact binary systems for which no light curve analysis had previously been reported. Photometric time-series data from the TESS mission were used in this analysis. The observational results were validated using additional TESS sectors, along with complementary photometric observations from the ASAS-SN survey. The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved. The positions of the systems and their stellar components were compared across four diagrams derived from empirical parameter relationship studies, showing good agreement with the linear fits.

TL;DR: MESS是一种全自动算法，用于在多时谱大型数据库中识别和表征双线光谱双星（SB2）。它扩展了二维TODCOR方法，通过全局多时谱形式优化模板，同时考虑了八个参数空间的连续光谱流形。MESS在LAMOST MRS模拟系统中验证了高达95%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决在多时谱大规模数据库中高效识别和表征双线光谱双星（SB2）的问题，MESS算法被提出以自动化处理此类任务。

Method: MESS扩展了二维TODCOR方法，采用全局多时谱形式优化模板，搜索八个参数空间的连续光谱流形（包括每颗恒星的有效温度、表面重力、旋转展宽，以及共同的金属丰度和通量比）。SB1和单星（S1）也被纳入同一框架，并通过贝叶斯信息准则进行模型选择。

Result: 在SNR=50的1500个模拟LAMOST MRS系统中验证了MESS的95%分类准确率。还分析了LAMOST中的两个SB2系统，包括通量比约0.1的弱次级星案例。

Conclusion: MESS算法在多时谱大规模数据库中表现出高效的双线光谱双星识别和表征能力，分类准确率高，适用于不同通量比的系统。

Abstract: We present MESS, a fully automated algorithm for identifying and characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) in large databases of multi-epoch spectra. MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars. A companion paper will report the survey-wide application to LAMOST DR11 and the resulting SB1/SB2 catalogs.

TL;DR: 研究了奇异矮星的结构，提出其由夸克物质核心和白矮星状外壳组成的混合模型，并探讨了旋转对其半径和质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索奇异矮星的结构特性，尤其是其核心为夸克物质的独特性质，以及旋转如何影响其可观测特征。

Method: 使用完全相对论性框架，结合Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff方程和Hartle-Thorne慢速旋转展开（至${\cal O}(Ω^2)$），构建静态和旋转模型。核心采用MIT袋模型，外壳为电子-离子简并系统。

Result: 旋转会增大半径，并在$(M,R)$平面内减少奇异矮星与传统白矮星的距离，可能掩盖夸克核心的结构特征。

Conclusion: 在解释质量-半径测量等全球观测数据时，需考虑旋转效应，尤其在未来高精度探测中识别奇异致密天体。

Abstract: We investigate the structure of strange dwarfs, modeled as hybrid compact stars composed of a self bound strange quark matter core surrounded by a white dwarf like crust, within a fully relativistic framework. Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\cal O}(Ω^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys.

TL;DR: 该论文通过MESA代码系统性模拟了五种磁制动（MB）形式对激变变星（CVs）演化的影响，发现MB形式的选择决定了周期间隙的形成与否，中等形式与观测数据最为一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同MB形式对CVs演化路径的影响，特别是对轨道周期分布、质量转移速率和周期间隙特征的调控作用。

Method: 使用MESA代码计算五种MB形式（Skumanich、Matt、RM12、中等形式和对流增强形式）下的演化序列，分析其对轨道周期、吸积速率和周期间隙形态的影响。

Result: MB形式的选择直接决定CVs是否形成周期间隙，中等形式与观测数据吻合最佳；强制动模型（如Skumanich）产生明显分离相，而自洽调节模型（Matt12、RM12）因角动量损失弱无法形成间隙。

Conclusion: 周期间隙的存在与否主要由MB在供体完全对流之前的强度和行为决定，未来研究需进一步纳入磁场对供体结构的调控作用以准确预测磁性CVs的周期分布特征。

Abstract: Context. The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways.
  Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners & Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics.
  Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology.
  Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs.
  Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs.

Abstract: Radio observations provide powerful diagnostics of energy release, particle acceleration, and transport processes in solar flares. However, despite recent progress in radio interferometric imaging spectroscopy, current instruments still face limitations in image fidelity and resolution, restricting detailed spectroscopic studies of flaring regions. Here we present high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy of a M1.3 GOES class flare with MeerKAT, a precursor to the future-generation array SKA-Mid. Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons. These results demonstrate MeerKAT imaging spectroscopy as powerful diagnostics of solar flares and pave the way for future solar flare studies with SKA-Mid.

Abstract: Wide-orbit binaries serve as crucial laboratories for understanding stellar evolution and identifying quiescent compact objects. In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions. The strategy of leveraging extended time baselines will be increasingly effective as spectroscopic databases continue to grow, enabling the systematic discovery of compact objects in wide orbits across the Galaxy.

Motivation: 研究动机是准确测量太阳风中湍流的大尺度极限（外尺度），避免全局通量绳趋势对其干扰。

Method: 使用无力通量绳拟合对Parker Solar Probe测量的磁场时间序列进行去趋势处理，并计算去趋势后的湍流相关长度。

Result: 去趋势后测得的相关长度在两个磁云中分别为$2.7\times10^{4} d_p$和$1.6\times10^{4}d_p$，显著小于未去趋势的结果；通量绳的贡献在最大尺度上显著增加了总频谱的陡度。

Conclusion: 去除通量绳趋势对准确测量湍流外尺度至关重要；湍流相关长度可能与磁云的中观结构相关。

Abstract: The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric variability of (presumably single) nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Magellanic Clouds, using long-term observations from the OGLE survey. Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.

Abstract: Electromagnetic scattering and absorption by material particles is a fundamental physical problem with a broad range of applications, going from laboratory experiments, biology and material sciences, all the way up to environmental studies and astrophysical investigations. In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications.

Abstract: Tree codes that approximate groups of distant particles with multipole expansions are the standard way to accelerate the computation of self-gravity on particles. While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code.

Abstract: Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology remain challenging, particularly in low-data regimes, due to complex forward operators and the frequent lack of well-motivated priors for non-Gaussian signals. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes. Our approach opens the way to new applications for non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals for which little or no prior modeling is available.

*Sebastiaan van der Tol,Sarod Yatawatta,Bram Veenboer,David Rafferty*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图像域网格化的校准方法，替代传统的离散方向校准，以消除方向依赖性系统误差的不连续性，从而提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统校准时，方向依赖性系统误差（如电离层或波束模式）的离散性需要通过额外的平滑和拼接操作来弥补，这可能导致效率低下和结果不理想。

Method: 采用图像域网格化作为校准模型，通过在傅里叶空间中表示一组子网格（而非离散方向）进行校准，避免了不连续性问题。

Result: 与传统面片校准相比，新方法在LOFAR数据中表现出更高的图像质量，因其系统误差模型更具物理合理性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法消除了传统校准的离散性限制，无需额外操作即可恢复宽场系统误差模型，显著改善了成像效果。

Abstract: Wide-field images made by radio interferometers are invariably affected by direction-dependent systematic effects such as the ionosphere or the beam pattern. Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space. This automatically removes the need for extra operations to recover the wide-field systematics error model without any discontinuity. We provide results based on LOFAR data where we compare the traditional facet-based (discrete directional gains) calibration with the proposed approach. The comparison shows improved image quality, mainly because of the physical plausibility of the proposed approach as opposed to using a piecewise constant model for direction-dependent systematic errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究暗物质的组成及其对太阳系的影响，尤其是通过PBHs的作用解释彗星的观测频率。

Method: 通过模拟奥尔特云受到暗物质（假设PBHs为暗物质）轰击的情况，分析其对彗星轨迹的影响。

Result: 若PBHs占暗物质的比例足够高，它们轰击奥尔特云可能导致原彗星脱离轨道并进入内太阳系，与观测到的彗星频率一致。

Conclusion: PBHs可能是暗物质的组成部分，其存在和行为可为暗物质的规模与性质提供线索。

Abstract: The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该研究建立了闭锁相位与宇宙21厘米信号功率谱之间的数学关系，利用延迟谱方法估计信号功率，并通过模拟观测验证其有效性。研究发现，闭锁相位的功率谱估计值与宇宙功率谱近似相等，但受前景依赖的窗函数影响，导致模式混合增强和前景功率沿视线方向的扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于校准误差会损害光谱保真度，传统的动态范围测量方法可能无法检测宇宙21厘米信号。因此，研究提出利用校准无关的闭锁相位来搜索信号的频谱波动，但此前对其与宇宙功率谱关系的理解尚不明确。

Method: 研究将宇宙信号视为闭锁相位的微扰，采用延迟谱方法估计信号功率，并使用标准傅里叶变换技术建立其与宇宙功率谱的关系，同时通过模拟HERA观测验证该方法。

Result: 研究发现，在信号与前景比值较小的情况下，闭锁相位的功率谱估计值近似等于宇宙功率谱与前景依赖窗函数的卷积。窗函数会导致模式混合增强和前景功率沿视线方向的扩展。

Conclusion: 研究为闭锁相位与宇宙21厘米信号功率谱之间的关系提供了数学基础，并提出通过标记窗函数较宽的情况来减轻负面影响。这一映射关系将有助于基于不同形状闭锁三元组的测量结果进行平均，提高灵敏度。

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic 21 cm signal need to achieve a high dynamic range to isolate it from bright foreground emissions. Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the spectral fidelity of the smooth foreground continuum, thereby limiting the dynamic range and potentially precluding the detection of the cosmic line signal. In light of this challenge, recent work has proposed using the calibration-independent closure phase to search for the spectral fluctuations of the cosmic 21 cm signal. However, so far there has been only a heuristic understanding of how closure phases map to the cosmological 21 cm power spectrum. This work aims to establish a more accurate mathematical relationship between closure phases and the cosmological power spectrum of the background line signal. Building on previous work, we treat the cosmic signal component as a perturbation to the closure phase and use a delay spectrum approach to estimate its power. We establish the relationship between this estimate and the cosmological power spectrum using standard Fourier transform techniques and validate it using simulated HERA observations. We find that, statistically, the power spectrum estimate from closure phases is approximately equal to the cosmological power spectrum convolved with a foreground-dependent window function, provided that the signal-to-foreground ratio is small. Compared with standard approaches, the foreground dependence of the window function results in an increased amount of mode-mixing and a more pronounced proliferation of foreground power along the line-of-sight dimension of the cylindrical power spectrum. These effects can be mitigated by flagging instances where the window function is broad. Crucial to gaining the necessary sensitivity, this mapping will allow us to average the measurements of closure triads of different shapes based on their imprint in cylindrical Fourier space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOD框架缺乏对星系内在排列（IA）的可微分建模，而IA对弱引力透镜分析至关重要。diffHOD-IA旨在填补这一空白，提供更灵活的建模和分析工具。

Method: 扩展diffHOD框架，结合HOD和IA模型，实现星系场的端到端自动微分。还支持两点相关函数的可微分建模，并通过Bolshoi-Planck模拟验证。

Conclusion: diffHOD-IA的可微分性和灵活性使其适用于下一代弱透镜分析，尤其是在场级推断流程中。代码已开源。

Abstract: We present diffHOD-IA, a fully differentiable implementation of a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that incorporates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA). Motivated by the diffHOD framework, we create a new implementation that extends differentiable galaxy population modeling to include orientation-dependent statistics crucial for weak gravitational lensing analyses. Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation. Finally, we apply diffHOD-IA in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis and compare its performance with halotools-IA and a neural-network-based emulator, IAEmu. Unlike emulator-based approaches, diffHOD-IA provides differentiability at the catalog level, enabling integration into field-level inference pipelines and extension to arbitrary summary statistics for next-generation weak-lensing analyses. Our code is publicly available.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文研究了原初能量涨落的局部非高斯性参数$f_{\textrm{NL}}$与星系偏置参数$b_1$和$b_φ$的关系，通过CAMELS-SAM管线探索了星系形成参数对$b_φ$和$b_1$的影响，发现SC-SAM模型的演化与$b_1$和$b_φ$的变化密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决$f_{\textrm{NL}}$与星系偏置参数$b_1$和$b_φ$的简并性问题，这是下一代星系巡天系统误差的主要来源。

Method: 利用CAMELS-SAM管线运行55个SC-SAM模型的变体，结合独立的N体模拟（$L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc，$N=1280^3$）测量$b_φ$，分析其与$b_1$的关系及对星系选择的影响。

Result: SC-SAM模型的恒星质量、恒星形成率和比恒星形成率与暗晕质量的关系与$b_1$和$b_φ$的变化高度相关，且sSFR选择对星系建模的稳健性较强。

Conclusion: SC-SAM的变体能够反映其他模拟（如IllustrisTNG）中的$b_φ$行为，sSFR选择是解决星系建模差异的稳健方法。

Abstract: The parameter $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ measures the local non-Gaussianity in the primordial energy fluctuations of the Universe, with any deviation from $f_{\textrm{NL}}=0$ providing key constraints on inflationary models. Galaxy clustering is sensitive to $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ at large scale modes and the next generation of galaxy surveys will approach a statistical error of $σ_{f_{\textrm{NL}}}\sim1$. However, the systematic errors on these constraints are dominated by the degeneracy of $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ with the galaxy bias parameters $b_1$ (galaxy overdensities caused by mass perturbations) and $b_φ$ (galaxy overdensities caused by primordial potential perturbations). It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_φ(z)=2δ_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_φ$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_φ$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_φ(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_φ$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling.

Motivation: 宇宙空洞作为研究星系形成和宇宙学的独特实验室，其星系偏置的径向依赖性受空洞定义方法的影响尚不明确。研究旨在比较不同空洞搜寻算法对这一关系的影响。

Method: 使用五种空洞定义方法（sparkling、zobov、revolver、popcorn）对同一星系样本（TNG300-1）进行分析，计算星系偏置随空洞中心距离的径向剖面。

Result: 不同算法在空洞中心的负偏置梯度表现一致，但密度阈值方法偏好b_i<0的星系，而无约束的分水岭方法包含高偏置边界星系的污染。popcorn方法在筛选反偏置星系上纯度最高。

Conclusion: 空洞定义的算法选择显著影响星系偏置的测量，尤其是边界区域的表现。popcorn方法在分离反偏置星系上具有优势，为后续研究提供了算法选择依据。

Abstract: Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.

TL;DR: 该论文回顾了DESI DR2数据后的晚期宇宙加速，探讨了SNe Ia、各向异性BAO、CMB校准及扰动敏感探针的相互作用，提出了诊断工具用于解释参数偏差，并分析了暗能量模型的微观物理约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于利用DESI DR2提供的高精度BAO数据，结合其他宇宙学探针，探讨晚期宇宙加速的机制，特别是暗能量演化和修正引力模型的可能性。

Method: 方法包括结合SNe Ia、BAO、CMB和RSD/弱透镜数据，分析参数匹配性；提出两种诊断工具：独立的BAO形状观测量F_AP(z)和SN系统误差的线性响应图；同时进行参数化和非参数化的暗能量重构。

Result: 结果表明，平坦ΛCDM模型存在轻微参数不匹配，而允许演化的暗能量（如CPL模型）能改善拟合；这一偏好依赖于数据集，并对SN校准/选择的残余敏感。最终将现象学映射到微观物理模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出，DESI时代需对SN校准有更高要求以避免系统误差，演化的暗能量或修正引力模型可能解释数据，但需满足扰动稳定性和引力波传播约束。

Abstract: We review late-time cosmic acceleration after DESI Data Release~2 (DR2), emphasizing the interplay between Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anisotropic BAO, CMB calibration, and perturbation-sensitive probes (RSD and weak lensing). DESI DR2 delivers percent-level BAO distance ratios over $0\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, including a Ly$α$-forest anchor at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$. In CMB-calibrated combinations, flat $Λ$CDM exhibits a mild parameter mismatch, while allowing evolving dark energy (e.g.\ CPL $w_0$--$w_a$) can improve the fit; the preference is dataset-dependent and is particularly sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration/selection residuals at the few$\times10^{-2}$\,mag level. To sharpen likelihood-level interpretation, we provide two diagnostics: (i) an $r_d$-independent BAO-shape observable, $F_{\rm AP}(z)\equiv D_{\rm M}(z)/D_{\rm H}(z)$, constructed directly from published $(D_{\rm M}/r_d,\,D_{\rm H}/r_d)$ with covariance propagation; and (ii) a linear-response map from SN Hubble-diagram systematics $δμ(z)$ to induced biases in $(w_0,w_a)$, yielding an explicit calibration requirement for DESI-era claims of evolving $w(z)$. We synthesize parametric and non-parametric reconstructions of $w(z)$ and $ρ_{\rm DE}(z)$ and map the resulting phenomenology to microphysical dark-energy and modified-gravity models subject to perturbation stability and gravitational-wave propagation constraints.

Motivation: 研究f(R)引力理论是否能解释宇宙晚期加速膨胀，并通过21厘米IM观测约束其参数B_0。

Method: 采用Fisher矩阵预测法分析BINGO和SKA1-MID实验数据，结合Planck CMB先验。

Result: BINGO初步约束B_0精度为2.27×10⁻⁶，SKA Band 2最佳精度达6.37×10⁻⁸；结合CMB数据可显著打破宇宙学参数简并。

Conclusion: 21厘米IM与CMB联用为宇宙尺度广义相对论检验提供高精度工具。

Abstract: Modified gravity theories offer a well-motivated extension of General Relativity and provide a possible explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. Among them, $f(R)$ gravity represents a minimal and theoretically appealing class, characterized by the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $σ(B_0)\simeq 2.27\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $σ(B_0)\simeq 6.37\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$. These results highlight the potential of future HI intensity mapping surveys, in combination with CMB measurements, to provide stringent tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales.

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来大规模宇宙学调查的偶极测量提供了更通用且可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: The cosmic dipole anomaly, currently detected at a significance exceeding 5$σ$ in several independent survey poses a significant challenge to the standard model of cosmology. The Ellis & Baldwin formula provides a theoretical link between the intrinsic dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of extragalactic light sources and the observer's velocity relative to the cosmic rest frame, under the assumptions that the sources follow a power-law luminosity function and exhibit power-law spectral energy distributions. In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey. We show that the anomalous cosmic dipole persists beyond the power-law assumption. These results provide a more general and robust framework to interpret measurements of the cosmic dipole in future large-scale surveys.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过微透镜效应探测原始黑洞（PBH），以验证其作为暗物质候选的可能性，从而深化对暗物质本质的理解。

Method: 利用Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam（HSC）对M31进行高频率观测，采用点透镜有限光源模型分析微透镜光变曲线，并通过多阶段选择程序识别候选事件。使用层次贝叶斯框架结合光变曲线拟合信息和泊松统计，约束PBH的参数。

Conclusion: 研究表明HSC-M31监测是研究PBH暗物质的独特且强大的方法，并建议未来进一步利用Rubin Observatory LSST对大型麦哲伦云进行观测。

Abstract: We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2~min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Abstract: Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.

TL;DR: 分析当前及下一代引力波探测器（如Advanced LIGO、Einstein Telescope和DECIGO）通过电磁明亮的标准警报器限制宇宙学参数的能力。结果表明不同探测器对各参数的测量精度差异显著。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究引力波探测器在约束宇宙学参数（如哈勃常数、减速参数和急动参数）方面的潜力，为未来的引力波天文学提供参考。

Method: 采用三阶泰勒展开法，分析信噪比和事件数量对哈勃常数（$H_0$）、减速参数（$q_0$）和急动参数（$j_0$）估计的影响。

Result: Advanced LIGO能实现哈勃常数的无校准测量（精度约百分之几），但对高阶参数不敏感；Einstein Telescope和DECIGO对$H_0$的精度可达亚百分比；DECIGO对$q_0$的精度优于10%，对$j_0$的精度为几十百分比。

Conclusion: 下一代引力波探测器在宇宙学参数测量中表现出显著优势，DECIGO尤其在高阶参数约束上具有潜力。

Abstract: We evaluate the capability of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and DECIGO, to constrain cosmographic parameters using electromagnetically bright standard sirens. By adopting a third-order Taylor expansion, we analyze how signal-to-noise ratios and the number of events impact the estimates of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. Our results show that while Advanced LIGO provides a calibration-free measurement of $H_0$ at the few-percent level, it remains insensitive to higher-order parameters. In contrast, the Einstein Telescope and DECIGO reach sub-percent accuracy for $H_0$. Notably, DECIGO achieves a precision better than 10\% for the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and a few tens of percent for the jerk parameter $j_0$.

Abstract: We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.

TL;DR: 通过星系团标度关系测试局部膨胀率的大尺度各向异性，并利用贝叶斯前向模型联合拟合X射线光度-温度和SZ效应-温度关系，发现对各向异性模型的证据较弱。


<details>

Motivation: 旨在验证局部膨胀率是否具有大尺度各向异性，并解决先前研究中因未充分建模红移-距离关系和速度场而导致的统计显著性问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯前向模型联合拟合LT和YT关系，隐式建模星系团距离，并自洽地处理局域速度场和各向异性红移-距离关系的影响。分析了312个低红移星系团。

Result: 未发现显著的各向异性证据，偶极模型的膨胀率变化上限为3.2%，体流速度上限为1300 km/s，与先前研究结果形成对比。

Conclusion: 强调了准确建模速度场的重要性，并建议进一步开发自洽处理大尺度流速偏差的重构方法。

Abstract: We test claims of large-scale anisotropy in the local expansion rate using cluster scaling relations as distance indicators. Using a Bayesian forward model, we jointly fit the X-ray luminosity--temperature (LT) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich--temperature (YT) relations, marginalising over the latent cluster distances and modelling selection effects as well as peculiar velocities. The latter are modelled using reconstructions of the local peculiar velocity field where we self-consistently account for possible anisotropic redshift--distance relations via an approximate scheme. This treatment proves crucial to the inferred anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between anisotropy in scaling relation normalisations and underlying cosmological anisotropy. We apply our method to 312 clusters at $z \lesssim 0.2$, testing dipolar, quadrupolar and general (pixelised) anisotropy models. Bayesian model selection finds no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model. For dipole models, we obtain upper limits of $δH_0 / H_0 < 3.2\%$ and bulk flow magnitude $< 1300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Our results contrast with previous claims of statistically significant anisotropy from the same data, which we attribute to our principled forward modelling of both redshifts and scaling relation observables through latent distances and our treatment of the impact of anisotropic redshift--distance relations when modelling the local peculiar velocity field. Our work highlights the importance of accurately modelling peculiar velocities when testing isotropy with distance indicators, and motivates the further development of reconstructions that self-consistently treat large-scale deviations from the Hubble flow.

Motivation: 探索ACT最新CMB数据对大场暴胀模型中VEV $M$的影响，以及该模型与后暴胀过程（如预热）的兼容性，特别是振荡子作为引力波和原初黑洞候选源的潜在作用。

Method: 结合ACT+Planck联合分析的高谱指数$n_s$及BICEP/Keck Array极化模式数据确立$M$的限制；首次进行了暴胀场晶格模拟以验证振荡子等遗迹的产生。

Result: 测得$⁠\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$（68%置信水平），$M/M_{Pl}\simeq 0.003$；模型生成振荡子，其引力波振幅在探测器灵敏度内但频率在GHz范围。

Conclusion: 模型与低$M$值及后暴胀过程兼容，但GHz频段的引力波信号远离预期范围；耦合项$yφσ^2$对预言有直接影响。

Abstract: The impact of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is studied for a model of cosmic inflation which predicts a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ for a large-field regime. Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polarization modes. We find $\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at 68\% confidence level, compatible with $M/M_{Pl}\simeq 0.003$, which is interesting for post-inflationary processes, such as preheating. We conduct a lattice simulation for the inflaton field for the first few e-folds, as the model is compatible with the production of relics such as oscillons, which are possible candidates as sources of gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $yφσ^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过Hilda-group小行星的观测数据验证动力学理论对共振轨道分布的预测，并探索Laplace-Lagrange线性摄动理论在共振区域的适用性。

Method: 使用von Mises-Fisher统计方法计算Hilda-group及其碰撞子族的平均轨道平面及不确定性，并与Laplace平面和木星轨道平面进行对比。

Result: Hilda-group的平均轨道平面与Laplace平面及木星轨道平面在统计上无显著差异，表明理论预测与观测结果一致。

Conclusion: 研究支持Laplace-Lagrange理论在共振区域的适用性，未来将扩展至柯伊伯带共振群体以进一步验证理论。

Abstract: Hilda-group asteroids librate in Jupiter's interior 3:2 mean motion resonance. We estimate that the Hilda group is observationally complete up to absolute magnitude $H\leq16.3$. This provides a statistically useful sample of thousands of resonant objects, all within a narrow range of semimajor axes, to compare with theoretical expectaitons of their orbital distribution from dynamical theory. We use von Mises-Fisher statistics to calculate the sample mean planes and mean plane uncertainties for the Hilda group and its Hilda, Schubart, and Potomac collisional subfamilies. Although Laplace-Lagrange linear secular theory is considered inapplicable within mean motion resonances, we find that the Laplace plane and the orbital plane of Jupiter are both statistically indistinguishable from the sample mean plane of the Hildas. In future work, we intend to extend this investigation to resonant populations in the Kuiper belt so as to further test the validity of Laplace-Lagrange linear secular theory for the mean planes of resonant populations.

Conclusion: 需未来JWST观测验证斯皮策结果，并进一步探究反常亮温的物理机制。

Abstract: We present the observation of a secondary eclipse of the young hot Neptune, AU Mic b, in the infrared using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Using a primary transit from Spitzer to constrain the system parameters, we tentatively detect an eclipse centered at $BJD=2458740.848893^{+0.00010}_{-0.000099}$ with an observed depth of $171\pm{29}$ ppm given an uninformed prior. This corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of $T=1031\pm{58}$ K, which exceeds the calculated equilibrium temperature of $606\pm{19}$ K. We explore some possible explanations for these results, including inefficient heat redistribution, gravitational contraction, stellar pulsations, instrument systematics and choice of eclipse depth prior, but find none of these to be likely explanations for the observed eclipse parameters. We also explore the impact of correlated noise in the systematic trends, and we find that splitting the systematics into low-pass (smoothing) and high-pass trends is required to reach an optimal minimization of the low-frequency systematics in the resulting detrended light curve. Future observations with JWST are needed to confirm our eclipse detection with Spitzer.

Abstract: At a 112.4 pc distance, the PDS70 protoplanetary disk is a rare case that has been confirmed to host two accreting planets. This makes it the most important laboratory for studying dust growth in the context of planet formation. Here we present the first deep, full polarization observations at 873 $μ$m wavelength. We detected $\sim$1%-2.5% linear polarization over the bulk of the $\sim$55-100 AU (sub)millimeter ring. The polarization position angles align preferentially with the projected minor axis of the disk. The standard interpretation is that the observed polarization is caused by dust self-scattering, with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$100 $μ$m. On $\gtrsim$10 AU scales, which can be resolved by the presented 873-3075 $μ$m observations, the ring is marginally optical thick at 873 $μ$m wavelength. Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we found that an azimuthally asymmetric, marginally optically thick ring with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$87 $μ$m can reproduce the observed 873 $μ$m polarization position angles and percentages. This study indicates that the coagulation of ice-coated dust in the protoplanetary disk may be limited by fragmentation or bouncing.

Result: 铵盐使行星盘气体中硫和氮丰度提升至太阳值的2-10倍。光化学模拟显示SO₂、NS、H₂S、NO和NH₃成为H₂O雪线内侧行星大气的主要氮硫化合物，SO₂光谱特征显著。

Conclusion: 铵盐主导的行星盘气体吸积模型为系外行星大气SO₂检测提供了新解释，氮硫比（N/S）和碳氧比（C/O）是区分传统固态吸积的关键指标。

Abstract: Observations of JWST have revealed that several close-in exoplanets have sulfur-rich atmospheres through SO$_2$ detections. Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario.

Conclusion: 氢气主导的系外卫星大气模型为长期宜居性提供了稳定解决方案，且具备支持生命起源的潜力。

Abstract: Exomoons around free-floating planets (FFPs) can survive their host planet's ejection. Such ejections can increase their orbital eccentricity, providing significant tidal heating in the absence of any stellar energy source. Previous studies suggested that liquid water could exist on such moons under thick CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres, but these models faced challenges with CO$_2$ condensation and atmospheric collapse, particularly in the high-pressure regimes that favoured long-term habitability. To address this, we employ a self-consistent model, including radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry with condensation, to simulate a more stable hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for a range of initial chemical compositions, including C, O, and N. We find that such atmospheres can effectively trap heat via collision-induced absorption of H$_2$, maintaining surface temperatures suitable for liquid water for time-scales of up to 4.3 Gyr, depending on the surface pressure, while not prone to condensation-induced collapse. Wet-dry cycling caused by the strong tides together with the alkalinity of dissolved NH$_3$ could create favourable conditions for RNA polymerisation and thus support the emergence of life.

Abstract: In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.

Abstract: The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale ΛCDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6μ\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.

Abstract: Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.

Abstract: (Abridged) We present stellar kinematics of the MUSE Most Massive Galaxies (M3G) Survey, comprising 25 galaxies brighter than -25.7 mag in the Ks-band and stellar mass above ~6x10^11 Msun. Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs.

TL;DR: ALMA和JWST观测揭示IRAS 07251-0248 E是一个极紧凑且明亮的核心，被遮蔽的AGN具有类星体亮度，其周围存在厚盘或环面结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IRAS 07251-0248 E的核区结构和物理性质，以理解其高亮度与遮蔽AGN的关系。

Method: 结合ALMA亚毫米波和JWST中红外的连续谱观测，提出核区模型，分析光学深度、尘埃温度和分子吸收。

Result: 核区光度为10^12 Lsun，表面光度密度为5e8 Lsun pc^-2；观测到的分子吸收线显示外流和盘/环面结构。

Conclusion: IRAS 07251-0248 E是一个被遮蔽的紧凑核区（CON），AGN亮度达到类星体级别，外流可能由辐射压或能量守恒的热泡驱动。

Abstract: ALMA continuum measurements of the local ULIRG IRAS 07251-0248 E at 667$μ$m reveal an extremely compact (R < 27 pc) and bright ($T_B$ >200 K) nucleus with an absorbing foreground envelope and a surrounding (R ~ 75 pc) disk or torus seen nearly face-on. The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($τ_{667μm}$ >0.5, corresponding to $N_H > 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at >500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $μ$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the "greenhouse" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $Σ_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $τ_{100 μm}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了高红移（z>6）超大质量黑洞（≳10⁹ M⊙）的生长机制，挑战了传统轻种子黑洞模型，提出了一种基于宇宙学的最小框架，支持通过重种子黑洞（∼10⁶ M⊙）在早期宇宙中快速生长的可能。

Motivation: 研究动机源于JWST发现的Little Red Dots（LRDs），这些观测暗示在紧凑的前星系环境中可能存在∼10⁶ M⊙的黑洞。作者希望重新审视早期黑洞生长机制，以解释高红移超大质量黑洞的存在。

Method: 采用了基于宇宙学的简化框架，结合Bondi吸积率和爱丁顿极限吸积率模型，通过贝叶斯推断拟合观测数据（J0313--1806和J0100+2802）。

Result: 研究发现，高红移超大质量黑洞的生长可能需要初始质量∼10⁶ M⊙的重种子黑洞，形成于z∼20-30的高密度环境（fρ≳50），生长过程中不需持续的爱丁顿或超爱丁顿吸积。

Conclusion: 研究支持量子简并费米子暗物质核心坍缩产生重种子黑洞的物理机制，为LRD现象和高红移超大质量黑洞的形成提供了合理解释。

Abstract: Quasars hosting $\gtrsim 10^{9}\,M_\odot$ black holes at $z>6$ challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that $\sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$ black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_ρ\gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.

Conclusion: Abell 30的电离和动力学特征揭示了冲击加热和多次喷射历史在其演化中的作用。

Abstract: This work presents integrated flux and velocity channel maps of the planetary nebula Abell 30 (A30) inner knot system. The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人马座矮星系（Sgr）最后一次穿过银河系盘面时产生的单次冲击是否能同时解释银河系盘面的多种扰动特征，如螺旋臂、盘面波纹、相螺旋和角动量-径向速度波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究通常单独分析银河系盘面扰动的成因，例如螺旋臂、恒星棒等。本文试图从整体角度出发，探索单次盘面穿越冲击是否能一次性解释这些观测到的扰动现象。

Method: 通过模拟人马座矮星系（Sgr-like）单次盘面穿越事件，分析这一强大冲击对银河系盘面扰动的影响，包括螺旋臂、盘面波纹、相螺旋和$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$波的形成。

Result: 模拟结果表明，单次盘面穿越能够较好地解释局部盘面波纹和螺旋臂（如外臂、本地臂和人马-船底臂）的结构、振幅和相位，推测最后一次显著冲击发生在700-1200 Myr前。$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$波和相螺旋在同一时期出现，但细节不完全吻合。

Conclusion: Sgr约10亿年前的最后一次显著穿越可能是银河系盘面大尺度扰动的主要诱因，但无法完全解释$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$波的形成，因此需要考虑其他因素（如银河棒或其他卫星的相互作用）。

Abstract: Prior to its infall, the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy was a major satellite with a mass of $M_{\rm sgr}\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. For the past $5-6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc.

Motivation: 探究原恒星形成早期阶段中密度结构与磁场的相对对齐特征，揭示重力与磁场耦合的机制。

Method: 使用ALMA观测数据，通过870微米尘埃连续谱推导柱密度图，并采用HRO方法量化磁场方向与密度结构的关联。

Result: 柱密度单独不足以决定对齐方式；弱磁化包层多为平行/随机对齐，强磁化包层在中等密度下即呈现垂直排列。

Conclusion: 密度和磁化水平共同塑造原恒星包层形态，影响重力与磁场的耦合过程。

Abstract: We investigate the relative alignment between density structures and magnetic fields in eight young protostars from the ALMA B-field Orion Protostellar Survey. Column density maps are derived from 870 $μ$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation.

TL;DR: 研究发现，AGN的[O III]流出与千秒差距尺度的射电发射之间存在关联，这种发射可能由AGN驱动，而无[O III]流出的AGN则以与恒星形成相关的弥散发射为主。

Motivation: 探讨AGN反馈对宿主星系演化的调节作用，尤其是电离气体流出与射电发射增强之间的联系。

Method: 利用ILT的144 MHz亚角秒分辨率成像技术，对Boötes深场进行大视场成像，分析了47个AGN的千秒差距尺度射电发射与[O III]流出的相关性。

Result: 90%同时在大尺度（6"）和小尺度（0.3"）检测到的AGN具有[O III]流出；51%有[O III]流出的AGN在小尺度被检测到，而无流出的AGN仅为17%。

Conclusion: [O III]流出与千秒差距尺度射电发射紧密相关，表明AGN驱动的喷流可能是关键因素，而无流出的AGN则更多与恒星形成相关。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Boötes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z<0.83$, $10^{40}<L_{\mathrm{[O III]}}<10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}<L_{\mathrm{144MHz}}<10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.

Abstract: The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $μ$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.

Motivation: 传统IFS发射线拟合方法独立处理每个光谱，导致拟合结果存在空间不连续性。ELFO旨在解决这一问题，提供更准确的物理和运动学分析。

Method: ELFO通过结合相邻光谱的拟合结果生成多个初始猜测，选择空间连续性最佳的拟合。工具包适用于IFS数据，特别是多普勒展宽发射线的分解。

Conclusion: ELFO显著改善了IFS数据的发射线拟合质量，具有普适性，可轻松适配其他IFS数据集和发射线类型。

Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides spatially resolved spectra, enabling detailed studies that address the physical and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium. A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.

Result: 发现两个系统为小合并，一个为大合并；合并未显著触发星暴，但引起颜色梯度和尘埃分布的扰动。

Conclusion: 合并导致的结构变化可能通过气体再分布或中性氢覆盖减少，促进Lyα光子逃逸，影响LAE的观测特性。

Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal that the merger fraction among Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) at redshifts $z > 3$ is significantly higher than previously estimated. In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at $3 < z < 4$, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new \textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$α$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.

Result: 三个BGGs的射电源呈现出不对称的延伸形态和不同的光谱指数（SDSSTG8102:-0.96±0.09；SDSSTG16393:-1.35±0.09；SDSSTG28674:-1.6±0.02）。X射线图像显示星系群形态拉长，SDSSTG28674可能是双合并的结果。射电源的形态和光谱多样性反映了AGN活动的不同阶段。

Conclusion: AGN活动与IGrM流动的相互作用导致射电源形态和光谱的多样性，这与AGN的周期性活动、射电源年龄和IGrM限制密切相关。

Abstract: Galaxy groups are affected by outflows from central Active Galactic Nuclei due to the shallower gravitational potential compared to galaxy clusters. The group binding energy is comparable to the energy output from AGN, making it an important factor in mutual evolution. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three dynamically active groups: SDSSTG8102, SDSSTG16393, and SDSSTG28674, which are part of the XMM-Newton Group AGN Project X-GAP sample, a statistically complete sample of 49 galaxy groups. We combine uGMRT 400 MHz observations with 144 MHz LOFAR and XMM-Newton observations to study the radio sources associated with the Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs). The BGGs in SDSSTG8102 and SDSSTG16393 have extended radio emission with asymmetric distortions in their morphologies. SDSSTG28674 has a compact flat-spectrum radio source associated with the BGG and an extended lobe on one side, connected by a faint bridge detected with LOFAR. Integrated spectral indices of the three BGGs are $-0.96\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG8102), $-1.35\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG16393), and $-1.6\pm0.02$ (SDSSTG28674). X-ray images reveal elongated morphologies in all three groups, with SDSSTG28674 showing evidence of a binary merger, while thermodynamical maps highlight temperature variations. In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix. The spectral diversity across the systems reflects different stages of AGN fading governed by duty cycle, source age, and confinement by the hot IGrM.

TL;DR: 利用JWST/NIRSpec对14个高红移静止星系进行了中分辨率光谱分析，发现恒星质量较大的星系更早形成恒星，证实了‘downsizing’趋势在z≈4时已存在。恒星金属丰度较高，但化学丰度测量存在模型依赖性挑战。

Motivation: 研究高红移（3<z<5）静止星系的恒星形成历史与金属丰度，验证‘downsizing’趋势的出现时间，并探究化学丰度测量的可靠性。

Method: 对JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据进行重新处理，采用定制最优提取方法消除PSF欠采样导致的‘wiggles’，通过全光谱拟合分析恒星形成历史和金属丰度。

Result: 发现恒星质量与年龄正相关，证实‘downsizing’趋势在z≈4时已存在；高金属丰度与低红移结果一致；化学丰度测量因模型和方法差异存在较大不确定性。

Conclusion: 高红移静止星系的恒星化学丰度测量仍需更高信噪比光谱支持，当前结果受模型和数据处理方法影响显著。

Abstract: We present deep, medium-resolution $λ=1-5\,μ$m JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 14 quiescent galaxies at $3<z<5$ with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}){\,>\,}10$, obtained as part of the EXCELS survey. We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral "wiggles" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological "downsizing" trend was already in place by $z\simeq4$. The slope of our measured relation ($\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at $0 < z < 3$. We do not observe objects with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 < z < 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $α$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $>100$ for $R\simeq1000$).

TL;DR: 论文研究了JWST发现的高红移红色小点（LRDs），通过光谱分析确认了其中两个LRDs中存在水吸收带，表明其光谱中存在低温（<3000 K）的稠密气体成分，并对黑洞质量等参数提出了修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRDs的红外光谱特征此前可能是由尘埃红化或稠密氢包层的低温热辐射引起，但缺乏决定性温度诊断。本文旨在通过JWST光谱分析解决这一问题。

Method: 利用JWST对四个高信噪比的LRDs光谱进行分析，发现两个样本中存在1.4 μm水吸收带，并通过大气模型拟合温度及成分贡献。

Result: 水吸收带的存在证实了LRDs中存在低温稠密气体（T≲3000 K），贡献20-30%的连续谱；复合模型显示温度范围为2000-4000 K，否定了单黑体辐射假设。

Conclusion: 部分LRDs的红光连续谱是内在性质而非尘埃红化导致，表明其辐射光度和黑洞质量可能被高估，为气体发射提供了新诊断手段。

Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are an abundant population of compact high-redshift sources with red rest-frame optical continua, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\sim 1.4 \, μ\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \lesssim 3000\, \mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\sim2000\, \mathrm{K} - 4000 \, \mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.
