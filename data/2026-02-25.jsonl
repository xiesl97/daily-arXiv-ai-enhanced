ACES provides the first large-scale, high-resolution ($\\sim2.5$\") view of the central $\\sim200$ parsecs of the Milky Way. In this work, we describe the continuum data processing and present the continuum data products. In the combined mosaic of 45 individual ALMA mosaics, the typical RMS noise achieved is $\\sim0.1$ mJy per $\\sim2.5$\" beam, though there is a tail of substantially higher noise toward regions with bright continuum structure, especially around Sgr A* and Sgr B2. In-band spectral indices are measurable for a small fraction of the brightest and most compact sources, enabling distinction between dust-dominated and free-free- or synchrotron-dominated sources. To recover emission on large angular scales, we present the GBT MUSTANG-2 Three millimeter Extended Nucleus Survey (TENS), a new 10\"resolution survey of the CMZ, which we combine with the ACES image by feathering. To demonstrate the quality and reliability of the ACES data, we compare to previously-published ALMA data obtained with higher resolution and sensitivity, finding overall good agreement with past results, but some disagreement toward the brightest sources."}

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches."}

Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization.

Comments and questions welcome!", "summary": "The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone (~1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales (~10 kyr for $α$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to ~1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects."}

Main text 15 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Gaseous halos around galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution. The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM ($\\lesssim3\\,$kpc) and CGM ($\\sim5-10\\,$kpc) for a sample of $M_{\\star}>10^{9.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$ main-sequence galaxies at $4<z<6$ with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4<z<6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \\texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\\rm CII]\\rm 158μm}/F_{\\rm Hα}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing."}

Focusing on the $α$-attractor scenario, we implement the model in a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to compute the relevant cosmological observables and perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and Type Ia supernovae. The model naturally breaks the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the total neutrino mass, yielding tight upper bounds of $\\sum m_ν< 0.067$ eV for flat spatial geometry and $\\sum m_ν< 0.116$ eV when curvature is included.

Prior work has advanced HOWFSC algorithms and profiled candidate implementations on radiation-hardened processors, highlighting a substantial gap between the computational demands of LUVOIR-scale HOWFSC and the capabilities of current onboard spacecraft hardware. In this paper, we argue that this gap can be closed by offloading the HOWFSC pipeline to a dedicated co-flying compute satellite at Sun-Earth L2. This approach enables the use of modern, radiation-tolerant high-performance processors without increasing risk to the primary observatory. We show that such an architecture can increase the end-to-end control cadence from the sub-hertz regime typical of radiation-hardened onboard processing or ground-in-the-loop operation to tens and even hundreds of hertz. We evaluate commercial hardware platforms in terms of performance and feasibility, and we propose custom architectures that enable higher control frequencies with significant power consumption reductions. Finally, we outline system-level considerations for co-flying compute, including reliability, satellite integration, and inter-satellite communication constraints."}

The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $Λ\\propto n a/(σa_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $σ$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\\mathcal{F}_i \\proptoΛ\\propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $ω$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs."}

We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode.

ULPT reorganizes the standard Lagrangian approach by separating the Jacobian deviation, which generates the nonlinear source bispectrum, from the displacement-mapping effect that determines how long-wavelength bulk flows distort observed configurations. Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements."}

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin."}

Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$λ$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{SMS}\\sim10^{5}$ M$_\\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $Ω_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $σ_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $Ω_{\\rm m}-σ_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model."}

Key findings include: (1) The wavelet-based combination methods overall outperform the baseline using only F10.7 index. The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al.

Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important."}

By incorporating stochastic forcing (parameterized by $κ$) alongside laminar angular momentum and eccentricity damping timescales ($τ_{\\rm m}, τ_{e}$), we derive an analytical criterion for the general $j:j-1$ mean motion resonances, and validate it through N-body simulations. The outcome is mapped in $κ$-$τ_{\\rm m}/τ_{e}$ parameter space, revealing two distinct regimes: resonance trapping and turbulence-induced disruption -- which occurs either directly cross or via temporary capture followed by escape through turbulent diffusion. Crucially, our analysis identifies turbulence as a universal destabilizer. It amplifies the intrinsic overstability mechanism: In laminar disks, escape requires $τ_{\\rm m}/τ_{e}$ to drop below a critical limit due to excessive eccentricity excitation. We demonstrate that turbulent diffusion lowers this limit, demanding stronger damping (larger $τ_{\\rm m}/τ_{e}$) for stability. Thus, greater turbulence promotes escape, and sufficiently strong diffusion precludes resonance retention irrespective of eccentricity damping."}

We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting.

We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive \"quantum birthmark\" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products.\n  We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission."}

Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts."}

While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3\" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations."}

To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\\mathrm{S}^1\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ (\"slab\") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters.

Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy.\n  Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).\n  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.\n  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\\rm RM}_I = 121 \\pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\\rm RM}_E = -44 \\pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales).\n  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI."}

Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $νL_ν\\sim 10^{39}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date."}

In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation."}

SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\\sc ii} $λ$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\\sc i} $λ$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae."}

Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $σ_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\\rm half}$.

Our best-fit orbital model predicts that W1 is at apocenter, implying that W1 has been closer to the Milky Way in the recent past, reaching a pericentric distance $\\lesssim 25$ kpc from the Galactic center $\\sim0.3$ Gyr ago. Given its internal kinematics, metallicity spread, and lack of mass segregation, we conclude that W1 is a galaxy. However, given its orbit and structural properties, which suggest that W1 might be tidally disrupted, and the difficulty of identifying a pure member sample, we caution that the measured internal velocity dispersion may not accurately reflect the dynamical mass of this system."}

We develop a radiative-thermodynamic framework that quantifies the maximum useful work extractable for a given star-planet configuration and yields exergy-based bounds on photosynthetic power and long-wavelength absorption cutoffs. From these we derive kinetically constrained red limits for high-$ΔG$ photochemistry and apply them to Earth-like planets receiving the same bolometric flux from FGK and M blackbody hosts, computing thresholded photon supplies and truncated exergy fluxes below a photosystem II red limit. For such planets the constraints confine single-photon oxygenic photosynthesis to near-infrared bands around Solar-type stars and to somewhat bluer wavelengths around late M dwarfs. Integrated over the stellar spectrum, the thresholded photon supply and truncated exergy available to drive a photosystem water-oxidation step are larger by factors $\\sim 5$ around FGK hosts than around $T_\\star\\approx 3000$~K M dwarfs. For the Solar-Earth system, the exergy-based upper bound on O$_2$ production exceeds the observed O$_2$ throughput by several orders of magnitude, consistent with Earth's photosynthetic efficiencies. Cool M dwarfs suffer a double penalty: fewer photons above threshold and a lower shortwave exergy fraction, yielding systematically tighter ceilings on high-$ΔG$ photosynthesis than around FGK stars. Our framework provides upper limits on photosynthetically harvestable power on habitable-zone planets and enables comparisons of photosynthetic potential across exoplanetary systems, and can be extended to multi-band photosystems."}

We examine the coupling between the photosphere and the chromosphere, studying the polarimetric signals during a period that encompasses the decaying phase of a C-class flare and the appearance of a new C-class flare at the same location. We focus on the analysis of various spectral lines. In particular, we study the Si I 10827 Å, Ca I 10833.4 Å, Na I 10834.9 Å, and Ca I 10838.9 Å photospheric lines, as well as the He I 10830 Å triplet. GRIS data revealed the presence of flare-related red- and blueshifted spectral line components, reaching Doppler velocities up to 90 km/s, and complex Si I profiles where the He i spectral line contribution is blueshifted. In contrast, the photospheric Ca i and Na i transitions remained unchanged, indicating that the flare did not modify the physical conditions of the lower photosphere. We combined that information with simultaneous imaging in the Ca ii H line and TiO band with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+), finding that the flare emission did not affect the inverse granulation or nearby plage, in agreement with the results from GRIS. We also complement the previous studies with a forward modelling computation, concluding that the He I spectral line emission reflects a complex response of the flaring chromosphere. Radiative excitation from coronal EUV irradiation, energy deposition by flare-accelerated electrons, and dynamic field-aligned plasma flows likely act together to produce the observed supersonic downflows and upflows. We plan to expand these findings through inversions of the He I 10830 Å triplet signals in the future."}

In previous studies, stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AFD) measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) records have been conducted on seven Ryugu particles. However, due to the limited number of samples, there is no consensus regarding the interpretation of the results of these measurements. To address this problem, we performed stepwise AFD measurements of the NRM on 28 Ryugu particles. Twenty-three of the particles exhibited one or two stable NRM components, whereas the remaining five did not. Isothermal remanent magnetization-based paleointensity values derived from stable NRM components varied by more than one order of magnitude. These NRM characteristics were consistent with those observed in previous studies. Therefore, as a reflection of the original nature of the NRM record, some Ryugu particles exhibited stable NRM components, whereas others did not. The Ryugu particles investigated in this study and those from a previous study exhibited spatially inhomogeneous NRM directions within individual particles, constraining the NRM acquisition time to before the final solidification of the current Ryugu particles. A mechanism of remanence acquisition that can explain the observed NRM characteristics is a chemical remanent magnetization associated with the growth of framboidal magnetite during aqueous alteration in Ryugu's parent body."}

Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism"}

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."}

We can confidently point radio telescopes to the positions of Fermi unidentified gamma-ray sources that have a high probability of hosting a pulsar. As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs."}

Previously there had been no widespread confirmation of sympathetic flares on other stars. In this work, we developed a new flare detection algorithm that is sensitive to closely-separated and overlapping stellar flares. We applied it to TESS data and discovered ~ 220,000 flares on ~ 16,000 stars, the majority of which are M-dwarfs. The wait time distribution between flares demonstrates an excess of closely-separated flares, relative to expectations from a Poisson process. We attribute this to sympathetic flares, occurring at a rate of between 4% and 9%, which matches the rate seen on the Sun. Our result is the first statistically robust detection of sympathetic flares on other stars, demonstrating a commonality between the Sun and low-mass stars."}

Therefore, understanding the physical processes during a solar flare and predicting its radiation profiles are of great importance. In this study, we analyze and model an M1.4 two-ribbon long-duration flare, whose multiple extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission peaks are found to correspond to different three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnections driven by the continuous evolution of a flux rope. In particular, the second and third peaks in the 335 Å EUV channel originate from longer and higher flare loops with extended cooling times, formed by reconnection between flux-rope field lines and ambient sheared-arcade field lines ($ar\\text{--}rf$) and between flux-rope field lines themselves ($rr\\text{--}rf$). These results are supported by the drifting of the flux-rope footpoint (and flare ribbon) and the decrease in toroidal flux of the flux rope, as well as by the connectivity transfer of representative field lines in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. This work points out, for the first time, new manifestations of the 3D flare scenario in EUV light curves. On the one hand, it provides an explanation for two-ribbon late-phase flares. On the other hand, the conclusions presented here help bridge the gap between imaging observations, EUV light-curve diagnostics, and the magnetic structures of the associated coronal mass ejections."}

We report new homogeneous redshifts for 34 quasars (from 40 spectra, adding 17 from archives) and summarize all available information about bona-fide quasars with reliable redshift, bringing their number to 124 within the mu_B=26 mag/arcsec^2 isophote. We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions -- probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates. Finally, the redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra must be treated with caution, because they can contain significant errors."}

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin."}

Accepted for publication in PRD", "summary": "Nearby pulsars within $\\sim1\\,{\\rm kpc}$ are considered to be possible sources of 10-500 GeV cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. A TeV halo around Geminga is detected by HAWC, and the measurements of its surface brightness profile indicate a slow particle diffusion surrounding the source. This result challenges the pulsar interpretation of the positron excess. The observations at GeV energies provide direct information on the electron/positron density in the GeV nebula, which can offer more direct constraints on the origin of the positron excess. Two previous works have performed analyses on the GeV emission of the pulsar halo, but focused on the energy band above 8 GeV. In this work, we use a longer dataset from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to re-analyze the GeV halo emission of Geminga, extending the analysis to cover the energy range of 1-1000 GeV. We find that the analysis in this wider energy range results in a low significance of the halo emission. This can be attributed to the Galactic interstellar emission model being unable to perfectly fit the background over this broader energy range, and due to the low measured halo flux at $<$ 10 GeV energies leading to a mismatch between the observation and model expectation. We also derive the spectral energy distribution of the tentative halo emission, which shows a very hard spectrum in the 1-10 GeV range."}

The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns."}

ACES spectral setup is tuned to observe optimal tracers of the physical, chemical, and kinematic conditions in over 70 spectral features (e.g. HCO+, HNCO, SiO, H40alpha, complex molecules) of the gas in the CMZ, to derive the properties of all potentially star-forming Galactic Centre gas, from global scales (100 pc) to dense ~0.05 pc structures that are expected to host individual star-forming cores, down to sub-sonic (<0.4 km/s) velocity resolution. In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ."}

We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 <= log Mstar/Msun <= 11.0 and redshift z < 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun > 9.9 and >= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z <= 0.07."}

The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well."}

From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of Hβ, [O III]λ5007, and Hα+[N II]λ6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of Hα and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies."}

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification."}

Comments and questions welcome!", "summary": "The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone (~1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales (~10 kyr for $α$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to ~1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects."}

The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $μ$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary."}

Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$).

The shear stress tensor no longer adheres to a single differential equation; instead, it splits into three non-degenerate components, each evolving according to distinct dynamical equations. Exploring these equations in a Bjorken flow scenario, we find that for large magnetic fields, our theory predicts oscillatory behavior beyond the scope of an Israel-Stewart-like theory."}

In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode.

Aiming at investigating the true structure of the inner stellar disk, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline for the chronochemical and dynamical analysis of galaxies (Glance: Galactic archaeoLogy via chronochemicAl & dyNamiCal modElling). The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite). It handles tasks such as Galactic extinction correction, de-redshifting, Voronoi binning, and nebular continuum correction, while offering extensive customization options. Parallel processing significantly reduces computational time. When applied to MUSE data sampling the central region of NGC 1566, this methodology reveals that its stellar disk significantly deviates from the conventional exponential model, challenging the assumption of universality in disk morphology.

Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\\sim 2.5~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\\sim 0.75~\\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments."}

Based on this, there are attempts to explain the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube with the accumulated contribution from a population of AGNs, but it is found that the maximum neutrino energy is less than tens of TeV and, as a result, additional source classes are needed to explain the high-energy component above this energy. Recently, motivated by the detection of >100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, it was shown that the turbulence acceleration in the corona can explain >100 TeV neutrinos given a larger magnetization parameter ($σ\\sim 1$) in the corona, which leads to a larger maximum proton energy and a hard proton spectrum. In this paper, we extend this assumption to the population of AGNs and study whether the population of AGNs with a wide range of magnetization can explain the entire diffuse neutrinos. We find that AGN coronae could account for the diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies if a significant fraction of AGNs have magnetization as large as $σ\\sim 1-10$. This conclusion is insensitive to the shape of the magnetization parameter distribution as long as the range of the magnetization parameter is sufficiently wide and the distribution is flat towards high magnetization. Interestingly, this model can also explain the peak of the diffuse neutrino spectrum at 30 TeV."}

We use new 1.15 and 2 mm continuum observations from NIKA2 on the IRAM 30 m telescope (IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Programme) combined with multiwavelength data from UV to radio. The infrared-to-radio SED is decomposed into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE. Dust is modelled via a modified blackbody (MBB) with variable millimetre spectral index beta and the THEMIS dust model with fixed beta. We perform spatially-resolved analysis at scales ~1.75 kpc (~25''), covering the centre, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. MBB fits reveal beta variations from ~1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to ~2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to ~4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from ~10% in the centre to ~15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc. Synchrotron spectral index ranges from ~0.6-0.7 in star-forming regions to ~1.2 in the diffuse medium, consistent with cosmic-ray electron ageing."}

Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($>$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB."}

In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation."}

Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well."}

An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted."}

HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone.

In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 < z < 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars.

They also serve as important observational tracers through $γ$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase."}

We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $μ= 24.85\\pm0.05$ ($0.93\\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters."}

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches."}

Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of \"satellite planes\" across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $θ_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\\mathrm{sat}}>20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes."}

Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances", "comment": "accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe."}

Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars. Our results deliver a practical, physically motivated prescription for per-halo IMF."}

Polarimetry", "comment": null, "summary": "Be/X-ray binaries are the most numerous group of high-mass X-ray binaries. Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts."}

Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\\sim 2.5~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\\sim 0.75~\\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments."}

SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\\sc ii} $λ$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\\sc i} $λ$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae."}

In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture."}

Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions."}

Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium."}

Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $μ= 24.85\\pm0.05$ ($0.93\\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters."}

Properties of SMC late-O and B supergiants reveal the metallicity dependence of winds in the Magellanic Clouds", "comment": null, "summary": "Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \\leq \\log{L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\odot}} \\leq6.1$ and $14 \\leq T_{\\rm eff}/{\\rm kK} \\leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$~kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC."}

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $Ω_{\\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $σ_8=0.81\\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $Ω_{\\rm m}-σ_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model."}

We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\\gtrsim60^\\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system."}

SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\\sc ii} $λ$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\\sc i} $λ$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae."}

In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification."}

The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns."}
