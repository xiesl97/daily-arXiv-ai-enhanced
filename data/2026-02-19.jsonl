Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Rapid inward migration driven by Type I torques threatens the survival of low-mass planets in their nascent protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Positive co-rotation torques offer a potential solution, but require viscous diffusion to remain unsaturated. However, it is unclear if (magneto)-hydrodynamic turbulence provides the necessary diffusion, and disk profiles supporting such torques are often also susceptible to the Convective Overstability (COS) for suitable gas cooling timescales. To this end, we investigate torques on low-mass planets through radially global 2D (razor-thin) and vertically unstratified 3D hydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with thermal diffusion and optically thin cooling. Our 3D models with thermal diffusion, which allows COS development, show systematically different torque behavior compared to 2D models, wherein COS is absent. In 3D, the COS saturates into large-scale, long-lived vortices that migrate radially and interact gravitationally with the embedded planet. When these vortices encounter the planet, they typically provide positive torque \"kicks\" counteracting inward migration, as the less-massive vortices are scattered onto horseshoe orbits by the more-massive planet. We validate our simulation methods against the theoretical framework of Paardekooper et al. (2011) and demonstrate that COS-induced torque modifications can extend migration timescales by factors of approximately 10. For plausible disk models, our results suggest that COS activity can lengthen migration timescales sufficiently to overlap with, or even exceed Super-Earth formation windows (0.1-5 Myr). In contrast, simulations with optically thin cooling do not show significant torque modifications, as COS saturates in near-axisymmetric structures without producing large-scale vortices for the disk models considered here."}

Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as $\\rm H_2O$, $\\rm CO$, $\\rm CO_2$, $\\rm C_2H_2$, $\\rm OH$. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., $\\rm C_2H_2$, $\\rm CO_2$) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as $\\rm CO_2$/$\\rm H_2O$ and $\\rm H_2O$/$\\rm C_2H_2$ - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps."}

Our updated model includes an incompressible, viscous gas that responds azimuthally and couples to the dust through drag. We show that the basic criterion for diffusion-slope-driven instability remains approximately $β_\\mathrm{diff}\\lesssim -2$ for small dust stopping times, with gas feedback providing only modest quantitative changes for parameters motivated by streaming-instability turbulence. We perform nonlinear numerical calculations and confirm linear growth and mode selection toward the fastest-growing wavenumber. However, for power-law closures $D\\proptoΣ^{β_\\mathrm{diff}}$ with $β_\\mathrm{diff}<0$, the nonlinear evolution does not saturate. Instead, steepening gradients amplify the nonlinear dust-pressure term and drive finite-time collapse into increasingly sharp spikes. Motivated by the absence of multidimensional saturation channels in our 1D framework, we test a simple piecewise closure in which the negative diffusion slope operates only over a finite density interval. This modification eliminates blowup and produces peak densities controlled by the imposed saturation scale. Our results support diffusive instabilities as a linear organizing mechanism in dusty turbulence, while highlighting that realistic nonlinear saturation requires additional physics beyond the present closure."}

The surfaces of its lobes contain similar amounts of highly volatile chemical species and few craters, indicating formation in a homogeneous and gentle environment. Arrokoth's bilobate shape was initially hypothesized to have formed via the direct gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud in the solar system's protoplanetary disk. However, alternative hypotheses have proposed that Arrokoth may be the result of binary planetesimal formation and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the binary components into contact through external perturbations over long timescales. Here, we show that contact binary planetesimals like Arrokoth can form directly from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. We used a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) to discover that planetesimals form a wide variety of shapes, including bilobate contact binaries. This method creates planetesimals as particle-aggregates with particles resting upon each other's surfaces via mutual surface penetration. The formation of contact binaries in our simulations strengthens the hypothesis that Arrokoth, and perhaps many other contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt, formed directly as bilobate objects from gravitational collapse, and so their shapes and surfaces record the era of planet formation."}

However, their low surface brightness, as well as contamination from compact sources and imaging artefacts, makes their detection challenging. The sheer volume of data from instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array will render traditional manual-inspection based detection methods infeasible. This paper introduces a novel machine learning approach that uses active learning to rapidly identify diffuse emission candidates from a small, optimally-selected subset of data. We apply the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to extract features from source cutouts in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We then pass these features through the Astronomaly: Protege anomaly detection framework to identify the final candidates. Using a human-labelled set, we evaluate our pipeline on high-resolution (~7''), convolved (15''), and combined-feature MGCLS datasets. Interestingly, the high-resolution features identify diffuse sources more efficiently than the convolved resolution, which are in turn outperformed by the combined features. Of the top 100 sources ranked by Protege, 99% exhibit diffuse characteristics, with 55% confirmed as cluster-related emission. Our work shows that Protege can identify diffuse emission with minimal human labelling effort, offering a powerful, scalable tool capable of detecting both known and novel diffuse radio sources."}

Broderick"], "title": "Foiling Black Hole Foils: Revealing Horizon Alternatives with Baryonic Atmospheres", "comment": "22 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Event horizons are a defining feature of black holes. Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models."}

The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$α$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$α$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$α$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets."}

The effect of the averaging scale on the characterization of interstellar turbulence", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "In interstellar medium studies, separating ordered and random velocity or magnetic fields is essential for interpreting turbulence in both simulations and observations. We investigate how the choice of averaging scale affects the measurement and characterization of magnetic and kinetic turbulence in Milky Way-sized disk galaxies with different initial magnetic morphologies. We analyze two magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies, one initialized with a toroidal magnetic field (Model T) and the other with a random field (Model R). Using spherical filtering, we decompose the magnetic and velocity fields into mean and fluctuating components while varying the averaging scale, and examine their energy ratios and power spectra as functions of time and averaging radius. Both models develop ordered and turbulent magnetic structures, whose relative strengths vary strongly with the averaging radius. The power spectra of the velocity and magnetic mean fields steepen with increasing smoothing scale, tracing the transition from coherent to turbulent regimes. The turbulent kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic counterpart, though the latter remains dynamically significant. Very importantly, we find that these ratios depend more strongly on the averaging radius than on the initial conditions of the magnetic field. The characterization of turbulence as strong or weak, meaning whether or not fluctuations dominate over the mean depends sensitively on the chosen averaging scale, rather than being an intrinsic property of the system. The strong dependence of the turbulence fractions on the averaging scale has direct implications for magnetic field estimates obtained from observational methods such as the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique emphasizing the need for careful scale selection when interpreting magnetic and kinetic turbulence in galaxies."}

The events, KMT-2021-BLG-0852, KMT-2024-BLG-2005, and KMT-2025-BLG-0481, were detected in high-cadence survey data from the KMTNet, OGLE, MOA, and PRIME collaborations. The anomaly morphologies are consistent with major-image perturbations induced by planetary-mass companions located near the peripheral caustic. A systematic exploration of model degeneracies, including binary-source scenarios, higher mass-ratio binary lenses, and the inner--outer caustic degeneracy, firmly establishes the planetary origin of each signal. Measurements of the angular Einstein radius and event timescale, combined with Bayesian priors from a Galactic model, yield the physical parameters of each system. The hosts are low-mass stars (0.12--0.75~$M_\\odot$), while the companions are Saturn-mass planets (0.16--0.59 $M_{\\rm J}$) projected at separations of 1.1--7.8 au, placing them beyond the snowline of their hosts.

Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling.

Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $Ω_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $Ω_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by ~80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging."}

Complementary MUSE observations on most of these clusters allowed us to identify an unprecedented number of cluster members, strongly enhancing the precision of our measurement with respect to previous studies. Our sample of cluster members is divided in four classes: red and blue by colour, and high- and low-mass by stellar mass. We employ two parallel techniques, namely the MAMPOSSt method (parametric in $β(r)$) and the Jeans equation inversion (non parametric in $β(r)$). The results from both techniques are found in agreement for any given cluster member population, and suggest that the orbital anisotropy in galaxy clusters grows from the centre (where $β\\approx 0.2-0.4$) to the virial radius ($β\\gtrsim 0.8$), and it is similar for the different cluster member populations.

Across the sample, the methods generally produced consistent results, though larger discrepancies were observed for some MBAs. TNOs, in contrast, displayed greater consistency across methods, likely due to fewer overlapping resonances. Importantly, clone ensembles provided more robust and reliable stability indicators than nominal-orbit computations. Median values from clone populations reduced method-dependent biases and revealed dynamical behaviors that would remain hidden in single-orbit analyses, especially for objects with poorly constrained orbits or evolving in resonant regions.

Despite extensive observational work, quantitatively comparing FD morphology across events and linking it to storm severity remains challenging due to heterogeneous station responses, coverage gaps, and the multivariate nature of the network. This work introduces a graph-based event representation in which each FD is mapped to an event network constructed from pairwise dissimilarities between station response time series. A controlled sparse backbone is obtained via the minimum spanning tree, enabling comparable event graphs across cases. From each graph, a compact set of geometric/topological fingerprints is computed, including global integration measures, spectral summaries, mesoscopic structure, centrality aggregates, and complexity descriptors.\n  Predictive skill is assessed using strict leave-one-event-out validation over a pre-defined grid of distance metrics and distance-domain transformations, with selection criteria fixed \\emph{a priori}. The proposed fingerprints exhibit measurable signal for three tasks: (i) multi-class classification of geomagnetic storm intensity (G3/G4/G5) with moderate but consistent performance and errors dominated by adjacent categories; (ii) stronger binary severity screening ($\\ge$G4 vs.\\ G3) with high sensitivity to severe events; and (iii) drop regression with partial least squares achieving positive explained variance relative to a fold-wise mean baseline."}

While the dominant effect of solar radiation on VTEC is well-known, a comprehensive understanding of how these relationships and their time-lags vary across distinct solar cycle phases and across cycles of differing intensity has been lacking. Using global VTEC data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Global Ionospheric Maps (CASG) and solar-geophysical indices from NASA's OMNI dataset spanning from 1998 to 2025, this study bridges that gap by quantifying correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and parameters such as $F_{10.7}$ solar flux, R sunspot number, Kp, Ap, and Dst indices, and solar wind properties. Results show that solar proxies, particularly $F_{10.7}$ and R sunspot number, exhibit the strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, with a characteristic $\\sim2$-day lag attributed to thermospheric oxygen dynamics and ionospheric recombination processes. In contrast, geomagnetic indices exhibit weaker and phase-dependent correlations, while direct correlations between solar wind parameters and global VTEC are weak, as their influence is primarily mediated by geomagnetic activity and exhibits strong regional and temporal heterogeneity. Phase-resolved analyses further reveal that geomagnetic activity plays a more prominent role during transitional phases, while maximum and minimum periods are dominated by EUV variability and non-solar drivers, respectively. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating solar phase and time-lag dependencies in ionospheric modelling and forecasting efforts."}

The analysis employs a scale-dependent growth equation and utilizes the fk-PT perturbation theory approach, implemented in the FOLPS-nu code, to compute the full 1-loop power spectrum multipoles, in particular, the monopole and quadrupole ($\\ell=0,2$, respectively). The results show that at redshift $z=0$, the monopole of both MG models is suppressed compared to $Λ$CDM, with the Symmetron being closer to the standard model, while the quadrupole presents the opposite behavior. To validate the pipeline, we use General Relativity (GR) mock catalogs (EZMocks), since suitable Symmetron simulations are not available. The main result is that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis successfully recovers the expected GR limit (i.e., $β_0 \\approx 0$) from the Symmetron model when applied to this mock data, confirming the viability of our methodology for cosmological inference. Then, we conclude that the pipeline is prepared to test MG models against current and near-future galaxy surveys."}

Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\\log_{10}(M_\\ast$/$M_\\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe."}

The uniqueness of this Geminid fireball consists of the record depth of its penetration in the atmosphere (to the height of 32.5 km) and in the fact that most likely a very small fraction of its initial mass survived severe deceleration in the atmosphere and landed on the ground. Such deeply penetrating Geminid with so precise and reliable data has not yet been observed. From a comparison with a large number of Geminids observed by the European Fireball Network and all brightest Geminids from the Prairie Fireball Network in USA and the Canadian MORP Network, we have shown that for Geminids with an entry mass greater than approximately 10 grams, the terminal altitude limit does not decrease further as it does for smaller Geminids, but remains constant at around 38 km. In this comparison, we have shown that there is only one exception, and that is the Geminid presented here. This one penetrated nearly 6 km deeper with very low terminal speed for Geminids. During the atmospheric flight this Geminid meteoroid slowed down from its original speed of 35.75 km/s to 6.8 km/s. This small meteoroid with initial mass of only 0.25 kg is probably the fastest candidate for a meteorite dropping event ever observed. This solid meteoroid belonging to the meteor shower survived a significant dynamic pressure of almost 2 MPa and thus ranks among the interplanetary bodies of asteroidal origin that caused the observed meteorite fall. Although a similar Geminid event has been previously presented in the literature, we demonstrate here that this claim was flawed."}

With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM ~ 2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by ~2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with ~0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom ~5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset."}

It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons."}

The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way."}

The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$α$ and Fe K$β$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$β$/K$α$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$α$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy."}

Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model"}

Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium."}

Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population."}

The distribution of observed magnitudes preserves this behavior, but is truncated by the detection threshold. If both the population index and detection threshold can be determined, observed meteor rates can be converted to fluxes and extrapolated to any desired brightness or size. We argue that the distribution of observed or instrumental meteor magnitudes is best modeled as an exponentially modified Gaussian (exGaussian) distribution. This is for three reasons: first, an exGaussian distribution is the natural result of random variations in detection threshold and/or post-detection measurement errors in magnitude. Second, an exGaussian distribution provides a better fit to the magnitude distribution than all other competing distributions in the literature; we demonstrate this using both a set of faint optical meteor magnitudes and a set of radar meteor echo amplitudes. Finally, the population index, mean detection threshold, and random variation/error terms are easily extracted from the best-fit parameters of an exGaussian distribution."}

The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$α$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$α$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$α$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets."}

A dichotomy has emerged in the population: some produce repeat bursts, while the majority do not. Most repeating sources only show rare repetitions, and none have been studied extensively over the wide bandwidths necessary to disentangle the physical processes that produce emission from distortions to bursts caused by intervening ionised gas. Here we present radio observations of the most active repeating source, FRB 20240114A. Using an ultrawideband receiving system, we have detected 5526 repetitions, revealing an extreme spectral and temporal variability in the burst emission. The bursts exhibit longer-term broadband variations in central emission frequency over multiple months, and narrowband bursts that have correlations in central frequencies on time scales of milliseconds to minutes. The spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the source undergoing magnification by foreground plasma lenses, potentially embedded in a turbulent circumsource medium. This extreme example highlights the role of plasma lenses in the observed properties of burst emission and can explain the diversity in activity and energetics of the entire FRB population."}

When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $σ_{\\rm SI}\\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one"}

We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of $0.123 \\pm 0.012$ $M_J$ and $0.213 \\pm 0.024$ $M_J$, radius of $0.604 \\pm 0.028$ $R_J$ and $0.991 \\pm 0.044$ $R_J$, periods of $10.06$ d and $12.85$ d and equilibrium temperature of $1086 \\pm 19$ K and $1040 \\pm 19$ K, respectively.

In December 2024, PG 1211+143 was observed simultaneously with XRISM Resolve and XMM-Newton, allowing both the Fe K and soft X-ray outflows to be examined at high resolution simultaneously. The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight.

Impact of galaxy intrinsic alignment modelling choices on Euclid 3x2pt cosmology", "comment": "23 pages, 16 figures, submitted to A&A", "summary": "The Euclid galaxy survey will provide unprecedented constraints on cosmology, but achieving unbiased results will require an optimal characterisation and mitigation of systematic effects. Among these, the intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies are one of the dominant contaminants of the weak lensing (WL) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) probes. In this work, we assess IA modelling choices for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses by comparing the performance of the two most commonly used IA models, nonlinear alignment (NLA) and tidal alignment tidal torquing (TATT), along with several variations. Our analyses combine three perspectives: i) the constraining power on the IA and cosmological parameters for each IA model, ii) the bias that results when the IA analysis model differs from the model used to generate the synthetic data vector, and iii) the degeneracies between IA and photometric redshift (photo-z) nuisance parameters. Among the IA models analysed, the redshift-dependent TATT model (zTATT) provides the most flexible description of IA, with a similar constraining power compared to simpler IA models, making it a well-motivated choice for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses."}

The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

The large prominence eruption is suggested to have been caused by a large mid-latitude spot on the polarity inversion lines near the stellar limb from the concurrent Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and optical photometry by the TESS. In this study, we perform starspot mapping for the TESS data of EK Dra to investigate the relation of starspots and magnetic fields from the photometry and ZDI. We also explore the multiwavelength rotational variability ascribed to starspots and active regions for the TESS, B-band, H$α$, and X-ray light curves. As a result, we find that (i) spot locations deduced from the TESS light curve are mostly consistent with the intensity map from the ZDI except for a polar spot, and (ii) the H$α$ light curve exhibits clear periodicity with respect to the TESS light curve because the H$α$ line is radiated around spots in the chromosphere. The X-ray light curve does not show such association probably because of multiple spots on high activity level and extended spatial structure of coronal active regions. The results provide clues to explore their association with stellar flares at different heights of active regions in chromospheric and coronal lines. Our study also enables us to quantify the stellar XUV radiation from the magnetic fields of active stars toward understanding atmospheric evolution of exoplanets."}

We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \\sim 4\\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \\sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $θ_j \\simeq 0.10$ rad ($\\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \\simeq 1.64$.

Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 μ\\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 μ\\mathrm{m}$ and $850 μ\\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $μ\\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field."}

However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes."}

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion."}

Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population."}

Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars."}

Comments and suggestions are welcome", "summary": "The redshifted 21-cm signal emitted by neutral Hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe to understand the evolution of the topology of ionized regions during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The topology of ionized regions allows us to infer the nature and properties of ionizing sources, i.e., early galaxies and AGNs. Traditional Fourier statistics, such as the power spectrum, help us quantify the strength of fluctuations in this field at different length scales but do not preserve its phase information. Analyzing the 21-cm brightness temperature field in the image domain retains its non-Gaussian characteristics and morphological information. One such approach is to track the coalescence of multiple ionized regions to form one contiguous ionized region spanning the universe. This is referred to as percolation, and its onset is quantified by a sharp rise in the value of the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS) approaching unity. In this work, we carry out a percolation analysis of 21-cm brightness temperature fields by studying the redshift evolution of the LCS along a lightcone to distinguish between several simulated reionization scenarios. We have extended previous results on reionization model comparison from the analysis of coeval 21-cm maps to understand how the lightcone effect biases the observed percolation behavior and affects the distinguishability of the source models. We estimate the LCS of subvolumes of different sizes in the 21-cm lightcone maps and study their redshift evolution for different reionization scenarios using a moving volume approach. We find that the percolation transition inferred from a lightcone approaches that from the coeval box as we increase the bandwidth of the moving volume in all but one reionization scenario."}

An N-body approach to the problem", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the A&A Letter", "summary": "Recent observations indicate that in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars appear more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. This contradicts most multiple stellar population (MSP) formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched (second) population (2P) should initially be more concentrated than the pristine (first) population (1P). Previous MOCCA Monte Carlo simulations suggested that this apparent overconcentration is a transient effect arising in clusters that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass and host an active black hole subsystem (BHS), and is visible only when RGB stars are used as tracers. In this letter, we test this interpretation using tailored NBODY6++GPU models evolved with direct N-body simulations, providing an independent validation that does not rely on a statistical treatment of relaxation. We performed direct N-body simulations with the NBODY6++GPU code, adopting initial conditions designed to reproduce the dynamical regime relevant to the proposed mechanism. The simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and the Galactic tidal field, enabling a direct comparison with MOCCA results. The simulations confirm that the spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars can be strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with the BHS. Preferential ejection of 2P RGB and their progenitors from the cluster center leads to a transient apparent overconcentration of 1P RGB stars, in agreement with earlier MOCCA predictions."}

The catalogues, images and uv-data associated with this data release are publicly available via https://lofar-surveys.org/", "summary": "We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \\textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum provides the standard initial conditions for cosmological perturbations. However, the largest scales remain only weakly constrained by CMB observations, leaving room for deviations such as an infrared (IR) cut-off. This possibility is further motivated by the persistence of large-scale CMB anomalies, most notably the low quadrupole power. In this work, we revisit several broad classes of phenomenologically motivated IR cut-off scenarios using parametrised functional forms of the primordial power spectrum. We confront these models with the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova data and derive updated constraints on the cut-off scale and associated features. Our results remain consistent with earlier studies, showing that although such models suppress power at low multipoles, the improvement in fit is marginal and does not overcome the associated parameter penalties. We therefore find no statistically significant evidence favouring IR cut-off models over the standard power-law spectrum with current data. We further explore the interplay between IR cut-off features and a possible increase in the reionisation optical depth, motivated by the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 within the $Λ$CDM framework. We show that the additional freedom introduced by large-scale suppression is generally insufficient to support a substantial increase in optical depth, owing to the weak statistical preference for suppressed large-scale temperature power. Finally, we examine the implications of IR cut-off models for large-scale CMB anomalies by analysing the corresponding anomaly statistics within a Bayesian framework."}

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion."}

These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction."}

We present the emission line properties of a preliminary sample of five jellyfish galaxies in the Coma cluster, observed with the WEAVE Large-IFU as part of the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS). When complete, CLIFS will form a sample of 29 jellyfish galaxies in Coma, selected based on the presence of one-sided tails in the radio continuum, enabling a comprehensive picture of the effects of ram pressure on galaxies in the Coma cluster. We extract emission line properties and confirm consistency between disk fluxes measured from WEAVE and MaNGA for galaxies with overlapping disk coverage between surveys. Comparing resolved radio and H$α$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$α$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$α$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks.

It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6<E<13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $α$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope."}

When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores.

We measure the positions of the five SN images with uncertainties varying between 1 and 14 milliarcseconds. We build the first mass models using lenstronomy and GLEE, and explore three classes of mass models for the two lens galaxies G1 and G2. The optimal model class of the three is a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1, a singular isothermal sphere for G2, and an external shear.

The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age.

The catalogues, images and uv-data associated with this data release are publicly available via https://lofar-surveys.org/", "summary": "We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts $Δt \\sim 100$~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from $z=12$ to $z=5$ (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law $dN/dM_* \\propto M_*^α$ with slope $α\\sim -2$.\n  At $z>9-10$ the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching $M_* \\sim 10^{10}$~M$_\\odot$), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst."}

Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling. This paper is a reference for current and future use of the CHARA Array and for next-generation instrument design."}

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion."}

As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored."}

The events, KMT-2021-BLG-0852, KMT-2024-BLG-2005, and KMT-2025-BLG-0481, were detected in high-cadence survey data from the KMTNet, OGLE, MOA, and PRIME collaborations. The anomaly morphologies are consistent with major-image perturbations induced by planetary-mass companions located near the peripheral caustic. A systematic exploration of model degeneracies, including binary-source scenarios, higher mass-ratio binary lenses, and the inner--outer caustic degeneracy, firmly establishes the planetary origin of each signal. Measurements of the angular Einstein radius and event timescale, combined with Bayesian priors from a Galactic model, yield the physical parameters of each system. The hosts are low-mass stars (0.12--0.75~$M_\\odot$), while the companions are Saturn-mass planets (0.16--0.59 $M_{\\rm J}$) projected at separations of 1.1--7.8 au, placing them beyond the snowline of their hosts. These results demonstrate the capability of microlensing to detect and characterize cold giant planets around low-mass stars at kpc distances, populating the critical transition region between ice giants and gas giants."}

Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$α$ and Fe K$β$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$β$/K$α$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$α$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy."}

Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium."}

The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM."}

While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \\textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin."}
