For groups binned by total\nluminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\\rm gal}$ from\ngroup-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo\nmass $M_h$.

Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve\nthe Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance\nrather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our\nsimulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by\napproximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova\nfeedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through\nAGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling\npreserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy,\ncreating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism\noperates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate\nAGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy.\nCritically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert:\nwithout SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too\npowerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match\nobservations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar\nshock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed.

Although dust is\ngenerally assumed to represent $1 \\%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations\nare expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading\nto enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to\ninvestigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense\nregions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes\nbeyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\\ttfamily shark} to perform\nmultifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas\nwith large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:\nWe identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently\nforms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong\nclumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high\nlevels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects\nin regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high\ntransverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse\nMach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust\nexperiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable\nconditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal\nMHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to\nsmall-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -\nlike mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density\nenhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure\nhydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in\nprotostellar envelopes a plausible scenario."}

Laboratory\nexperiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can\nreact with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to\nCOMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to\nexplore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction\nwith CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase\nchemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse\nthrough to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include\nNH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice\nproducts and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud,\nincluding sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low\ntemperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its\nformation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal\nreaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface\nhydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of\n~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance\npeak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core\nconditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity.\nMolecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species\nseem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated\ninterstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to\nmore complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule\ngas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked\nlower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and\nlifetimes."}

We\ninvestigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry.\nTemperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux\nalters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere\nthrough vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow\nthermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers,\nspecies mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to\nthe regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When\nthe quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\\rm CH_4$, and $\\rm\nH_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are\nmodified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature\nvariation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other\nspecies (e.g. NO and $\\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose\nquenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing\nratios of $\\rm CH_4$, $\\rm H_2O$, and $\\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower\natmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in\nthe upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\\rm CO_2$, and NO\nrise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the\nupper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the\noverall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar\neffect.

In this paper we compare\nand contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and\ntidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying\nin particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size,\nrotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad\n(which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model\nthat contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet\nremains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the\nbehavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a\nMatsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is\ninsufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are\nadditional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the\nsuperrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in\nstatistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate:\nsubrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak\nlow-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is\nalways linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of\nsuperrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the\ncontinuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from\naxisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively\nstronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly\ndominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing\nsuperrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist.

Their\nshort-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis\nacceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term\nevolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of\nthe structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the\nso-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where\nthe local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is\nneglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this\napproximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal\nflow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into\naccount. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we\ntake into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and\nviscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs\ndamping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling\nmust be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited,\nwhich is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using\nthe TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and\nshear-induced breakings are proposed.

A localized, modest\ntemperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an\noutward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges\nin the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the\nstar. We obtain a Ni56 yield of ~0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element\n(Si-Ca) mass of ~0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching\n22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results\ndemonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long\ntimescales, can evolve under subtle, \"quiet\" conditions to trigger robust\ndouble detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae."}

Their\nshort-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis\nacceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term\nevolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of\nthe structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the\nso-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where\nthe local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is\nneglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this\napproximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal\nflow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into\naccount.

These\nobjects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of\ntype-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We\nhighlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a\ntype-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN\n2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I\nsupernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than\n200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that\nexhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao.

While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and\ndynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped\ncold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo.\nUsing high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find\nthat CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds.\nSpecifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface\narea and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in\nmass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the\ncentral galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to\nthe no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass\nin the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in\nsimulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal\ngas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating\nthe cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability\nto feed galaxies."}

There are no fast-moving runaways being fast\nrotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal\nstars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate\nfaster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast\nrotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS\ndominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach\nrunaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D\nvelocities > 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while\nrunaways with 2D velocities > 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step\nproducts. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that\nmost Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS\namong fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity\nones. (Abridged)"}

Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of\nthe spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we\nfind that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we\nprioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our\nspectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These\nobjects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of\ntype-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We\nhighlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a\ntype-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN\n2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I\nsupernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than\n200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that\nexhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our\nprevious finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of\nextremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin\nof transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal\ndisruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present\nCSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220\nthat occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6."}

The\nidentification and characterisation of these modes requires high\nsignal-to-noise and frequency resolution. The KEYSTONE project unlocks the\nasteroseismic potential of the K2 mission by providing individually reduced,\nhigh-quality time series data, global asteroseismic parameters, and\nspectroscopic analysis for 173 solar-like oscillators. In this work, we build\non the KEYSTONE project and present the first analysis of the pattern of\nindividual modes in the oscillation spectra for the K2 KEYSTONE stars. We\nperform a robust identification and characterisation of the modes through\npeakbagging methods in the open-source analysis tool PBjam. We present over\n6000 mode frequencies, widths, and heights for 168 stars in the sample,\ncovering the HR diagram from FGK dwarfs to sub-giants and the lower red giant\nbranch, providing a significant increase in the number of individual mode\nfrequency detections for main sequence and sub-giant oscillators. This study\nalso presents sample-wide trends of oscillation patterns as a function of the\nfundamental stellar properties, and improves the precision of the global\nasteroseismic parameters. These measurements are part of the legacy of the K2\nmission, and can be used to perform detailed modelling to improve the precision\nof fundamental properties of these stars.

Although dust is\ngenerally assumed to represent $1 \\%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations\nare expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading\nto enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to\ninvestigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense\nregions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes\nbeyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\\ttfamily shark} to perform\nmultifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas\nwith large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results:\nWe identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently\nforms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong\nclumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high\nlevels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects\nin regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high\ntransverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse\nMach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust\nexperiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable\nconditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal\nMHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to\nsmall-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability -\nlike mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density\nenhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure\nhydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in\nprotostellar envelopes a plausible scenario."}

The relative contributions of binary\nsupernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway\norigin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way.

We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic\ninformation to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational\nvelocities ($v \\sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional\ninformation about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic\nbinary nature.

We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type\nrunaways, most (74%) have $v \\sin{i}<200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this\nfraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast\nrotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal\nstars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate\nfaster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast\nrotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS\ndominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach\nrunaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D\nvelocities > 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while\nrunaways with 2D velocities > 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step\nproducts. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that\nmost Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS\namong fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity\nones. (Abridged)"}
