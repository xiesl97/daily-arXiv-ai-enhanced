### [1] [An Interactive Metrics Dashboard for the Keck Observatory Archive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09126)
*G. Bruce Berriman,Min Phone Myat Zaw*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) 正在进行现代化改造，采用基于 Python 的新基础设施以应对数据激增，并开发了一个实时监控仪表盘以优化性能和规划升级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KOA 原有的架构无法满足新仪器和瞬变源数据的快速增长需求，需要现代化改造以提高查询效率和实时数据访问能力。

Method: KOA 开发了基于 Python 的新型基础设施，采用 Plotly-Dash 框架和 R-tree 索引，实现快速查询（提升 20 倍），并构建实时监控仪表盘以评估档案性能和增长。

Result: 新系统实现了近实时（1 分钟内）数据摄入和即时访问，查询效率大幅提升。

Conclusion: 现代化改造和实时监控仪表盘将有效支持 KOA 未来扩展，满足复杂数据集和瞬变源警报的需求。

Abstract: Since 2004, the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) has operated as a NASA-funded collaboration between the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute ( NExScI) and the W.M. Keck Observatory. It ingests and serves all data acquired by the twin 10-meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In the past three years, KOA has begun a modernization program to replace the architecture and systems used since the archive's creation with a new modern Python-based infrastructure. This infrastructure will position KOA to respond to the rapid growth of new and complex data sets that will be acquired by new instruments now in development, and enable follow-up to identify the deluge of alerts of transient sources expected by new survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2022, KOA has ingested new data in near-real time, generally within one minute of creation, and has made them immediately accessible to observers through a dedicated web interface. The archive is now deploying a new, scalable, Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure built with the Plotly-Dash framework and R-tree indices to speed-up queries by a factor of 20.
  The project described here exploits the new query infrastructure to develop a dashboard that will return live metrics on the performance and growth of the archive. These metrics assess the current health of the archive and guide planning future hardware and software upgrades. This single dashboard will enable, for example, monitoring of real-time ingestion, as well as studying the long-term growth of the archive. Current methods of gathering metrics that have been in place since the archive opened will not support the archive as it continues to scale. These methods suffer from high latency, are not optimized for on-demand metrics, are scattered among various tools, and are cumbersome to use.

TL;DR: SPHEREx首次在0.75至5.0微米范围内进行全天空近红外光谱测量，本文介绍了其地面光谱校准过程、结果及飞行验证，校准产品已发布以支持数据使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为确保SPHEREx任务数据的准确性和可靠性，需对其进行全面的地面光谱校准，验证其设计与实际性能的一致性。

Method: 使用线性可变滤光片和六台H2RG探测器进行位置依赖的光谱响应测量，通过单色波长扫描分析光谱响应函数、波段中心和分辨率。

Result: 波段中心在0.75至3.82微米范围内测量精度优于1纳米，3.82至5.0微米范围优于10纳米；分辨率测量误差在5%以内。飞行验证与地面校准结果一致。

Conclusion: 校准结果符合设计预期，校准产品已公开支持数据使用，未来将通过飞行测量进一步改善绝对光谱校准精度。

Abstract: The Spectro Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) is conducting the first all-sky near infrared spectral survey spanning 0.75 to 5.0um with resolving power R~35 to 130. Linear variable filters mounted in front of six H2RG detectors produce a position dependent spectral response across the focal plane.
  This paper presents the ground-based spectral calibration of SPHEREx, including the cryogenic apparatus, optical configuration, measurement strategy, analysis pipeline, and resulting calibration products. Monochromatic wavelength scans are used to derive the spectral response function, band center, and resolving power for every pixel. Band centers are measured to better than 1nm for Bands 1 through 4 (0.75 to 3.82um) and better than 10nm for Bands 5 and 6 (3.82 to 5.0um). Out-of-band leakage is negligible for detectors above 1.64um and is present at the percent level below this wavelength. The resolving power is measured to within 5% and agrees with design expectations to within 10%.
  An on-sky spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) constructed from repeated observations provides in-flight verification and shows agreement between ground calibrated response and astrophysical emission features. Calibration products, including per-pixel band center and resolving power maps, are released through IPAC to support community use of SPHEREx data. The absolute spectral calibration will continue to improve through in-flight measurements, with further reductions in uncertainty expected for the longest-wavelength bands.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and scientific potential of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a space mission concept enabling purely geometric distance measurements to sources at hundreds of megaparsecs by directly detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature. CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.
  We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.
  Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution. The most significant viability issue concerns FRB properties at several-GHz frequencies; we recommend observational campaigns to characterize repeating FRBs in this band.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于BYOL的自监督机器学习框架astromorph，用于高效探索天文数据集的形态特征，支持不同维度和分辨率的数据，并展示了其在两个不同天文领域的应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代望远镜生成的数据集庞大且复杂，需要自动化方法提取和组织物理信息，避免人工干预。本文旨在提供一种用户友好的自监督框架，以高效探索天文数据的形态特征。

Method: 基于BYOL方法，astromorph实现了无需人工标签的图像嵌入生成，支持单通道FITS图像和多通道光谱立方体数据。框架提供便捷的流水线脚本和PyTorch自定义选项。

Result: 在ALMA观测的原行星盘和Spitzer/Herschel观测的红外暗云两个案例中，astromorph生成了捕捉形态差异和相似性的科学嵌入，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: astromorph是一个鲁棒的无标签方法，适用于多种天文图像数据集，为观测天文学的发现提供了用户友好的工具。

Abstract: Modern telescopes generate increasingly large and diverse datasets, often consisting of complex and morphologically rich structures. To efficiently explore such data requires automated methods that can extract and organize physically meaningful information, ideally without the need for extensive manual interaction. We aim to provide a user-friendly implementation of a self-supervised machine learning framework to explore morphological properties of large datasets, based on the BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latents) method. By enabling the generation of meaningful image embeddings without manually labelled data, the framework will enable key tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity based exploration. In contrast to existing BYOL implementations, astromorph accommodates data of varying dimensions and resolutions, including both single-channel FITS images and multi-channel spectral cubes. The package is built with usability in mind, offering streamlined pipeline scripts for ease of use as well as deeper customization options via PyTorch-based classes. To demonstrate the utility of astromorph, we apply it in two contrasting science cases representing different astronomical domains: images of protoplanetary disks observed with ALMA, and infrared dark clouds observed with Spitzer and Herschel. In both cases, we demonstrate how astromorph produces scientifically meaningful embeddings that capture morphological differences and similarities across large samples. astromorph enables users to apply a robust, label-free approach for uncovering morphological patterns in astronomical datasets. The successful application to two markedly different datasets suggest that the pipeline is broadly applicable across a wide range of imaging-rich astronomical context, providing a user friendly tool for advancing discovery in observational astronomy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够在多个温度平台同时提供冷却的CADR系统，以减少传统多阶段CADR的复杂性和质量。

Method: 采用三阶段连续绝热去磁制冷技术，通过优化的热开关操作和阶段序列设计，实现两个不同温度的冷却平台。

Result: 该系统在1 K和300 mK下分别实现了20 μW和4 μW的冷却功率。

Conclusion: 该设计为多阶段连续CADR的发展提供了新的策略，具有更低的复杂性和质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a three-stage continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (CADR) simultaneously providing cooling platforms at two different temperatures. Unlike conventional CADR with two continuous stages, this system does not require an extra continuous stage. It is achieved with carefully designed heat switch operations and stage sequences. This new strategy significantly reduces system complexity and mass. The detailed implementation of the two cooling platforms is described, and factors limiting system performance are analyzed. This CADR system has achieved a cooling power of 20 μW@1 K and 4 μW@300 mK simultaneously, offering a new design strategy for the development of CADR with multiple continuous stages.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了一种通过高速飞越测量潜在危险小行星质量的技术，用于快速侦察的行星防御场景。研究通过主机航天器和CubeSat协作，结合短程星间测量，显著提升了质量测量灵敏度。结果显示，无线电频率测量对小行星效果有限，但激光或高精度多普勒系统可测量小至50米的小行星质量。最后机动时机对小物体的测量效果影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种快速测量潜在危险小行星质量的技术，以支持行星防御任务，尤其是在高速飞越场景下。

Method: 采用主机航天器和CubeSat协同飞越的方法，主机靠近小行星飞越，CubeSat保持远距离飞越。结合短程星间测量（如无线电频率、激光或高精度多普勒系统）提升质量测量灵敏度。通过模拟不同飞行速度（1.7至22 km/s）的场景评估技术有效性。

Result: 无线电频率测量对50-500米直径小行星效果不佳；激光或多普勒系统可将测量范围扩展到小至100米的小行星（所有场景），甚至50米（速度<8 km/s场景）。最后机动时机对最小物体的测量效果影响显著。

Conclusion: 激光或多普勒系统能显著提升小行星质量测量的灵敏度，但小物体的光学探测延迟和导航精度限制了最小目标的测量效果。

Abstract: This study evaluates a technique for determining the mass of a potentially hazardous asteroid from a high-speed flyby in the context of a rapid reconnaissance planetary defense scenario. We consider a host spacecraft that dispenses a small CubeSat, which acts as a test-mass. Both spacecraft perform approach maneuvers to target their flyby locations, with the host targeting a close proximity flyby and the CubeSat targeting a distant flyby. By incorporating short-range intersatellite measurements between the host and the CubeSat, the mass measurement sensitivity is substantially improved. We evaluate a set of proposed host and CubeSat hardware options against the 2023 and 2025 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical threats, as well as a hypothetical flyby of 2024 YR4. These scenarios differ predominantly in their flyby speeds, which span from 1.7 to 22 km/s. Based on these scenarios, we demonstrate that a typical radio-frequency intersatellite measurement is ineffective for asteroids with diameters relevant to planetary defense (i.e., 50 - 500 m). However, we find that augmenting the system with a laser-based intersatellite ranging system or a high-precision Doppler system can enable mass measurements of asteroids as small as 100 m across all cases, and as small as 50 m for the slower (< 8 km/s) cases. The results are very sensitive to the timing of the final maneuver, which is used to target the low-altitude flyby point. This presents an operational challenge for the smallest objects, where optical detection times are comparatively late and the optical navigation targeting knowledge converges too slowly.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过融合预训练语言模型与领域特定的物理知识来增强大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂数值数据上推理能力的方法，展示了其在科学任务中的高效性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大语言模型虽然在科学任务中展现出潜力，但对复杂数值数据的推理能力仍有待探索。本文旨在通过融入领域特定的物理知识，提升LLMs的科学推理能力。

Method: 采用师生知识蒸馏框架，将大型LLM（教师）生成的合成问答数据用于训练小型LLM（学生），学生模型通过轻量级适配器和LoRA技术学习潜在物理特征。

Result: 在1B到32B参数的模型上，该方法显著优于Gemini 3 Pro等基线模型，且无需任务特定微调即可在多任务中表现出色。模型还能通过潜在空间的方向“引导”预测复杂属性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通用框架，将LLMs作为科学潜在空间的可解释接口，实现了通过自然语言指导的多任务能力，为科学LLMs的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unique opportunities for scientific tasks, yet their ability to reason over complex numerical data remains largely unexplored. We propose a simple mechanism to introduce domain-specific physical knowledge into LLMs by fusing pre-trained latent physical features with a pre-trained language model. Our method employs a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where a large LLM (teacher) generates synthetic question-answer supervision to transfer physical reasoning to a smaller LLM (student). The student is conditioned on latent physical features and trained via a lightweight adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We demonstrate that this approach, applied to models with 1B, 8B, and 32B parameters, enables effective reasoning over real scientific data. Our models substantially outperform strong baselines, such as Gemini 3 Pro, across multiple downstream tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. We show that the model combines latent information with general physical understanding to predict complex properties and can be "steered" by identifying physically meaningful directions in the latent space. This allows for explicit physical manipulation and natural language interpretation of latent structures. While our experiments focus on astrophysics, the framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to various scientific fields. Our main contribution is a general framework for using LLMs as interpretable interfaces to scientific latent spaces, enabling a single model to perform diverse tasks through natural language guidance. This work marks a step toward developing scientifically capable and useful LLMs.

TL;DR: 总结了2024年对COS FUV数据校准的重大改进，包括几何畸变、delta几何和walk校正的更新，以及由此衍生的56个新参考文件的创建，最终提升了波长和通量校准的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是改进COS FUV数据的几何畸变、delta几何和walk校正，以提升校准数据的质量。

Method: 通过更新CalCOS数据处理流程中的早期校正步骤（几何畸变、delta几何和walk校正），并重新推导所有下游参考文件（共56个），以适应新的校正框架。

Result: 成功创建了新版本的参考文件，适用于生命周期位置1至6，显著提升了COS FUV光谱的波长和通量校准精度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过更新校正方法和参考文件，实现了COS FUV数据校准的显著改进，为后续研究提供了更高质量的数据基础。

Abstract: The calibration of Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) data is performed by the data processing pipeline known as CalCOS. CalCOS utilizes several reference files that store information required for data processing (e.g., dispersion solutions), and these reference files can be updated for the purpose of improving calibrated data products. In 2024 a major effort to improve the far-ultraviolet (FUV) geometric distortion, delta-geometric, and walk corrections was completed. Those three corrections occur early in the CalCOS workflow and shift photon events into the corrected reference frame ((XCORR, YCORR) coordinate system) in which subsequent calibration steps-and their reference files-are defined. This change necessitated the re-derivation of all "downstream" reference files in use at the time. Here we summarize the effort to create new versions of 56 reference files applicable to lifetime positions 1 through 6 and intended for use with the new geometric distortion, delta geometric, and walk corrections. The primary outcome of this work is improved wavelength and flux calibrations for COS FUV spectra.

TL;DR: 本研究通过哈勃太空望远镜对21颗Y矮星进行了均匀的近红外光度测量，改进了PSF拟合和校准程序，揭示了Y矮星在近红外颜色-星等图中的清晰序列，并与现有大气模型进行了对比，指出了模型的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Y矮星是最冷的一类褐矮星，有效温度低于500K，是研究冷巨系外行星的重要类比对象。通过高精度观测，可以揭示Y矮星的冷却序列并为理论模型提供实证约束。

Method: 研究使用了哈勃太空望远镜WFC3/IR仪器的F105W、F125W和F160W波段，对21颗Y矮星进行了光度测量，并采用改进的PSF拟合和校准方法，将光度误差控制在0.02-0.05星等范围内。

Result: 研究发现Y矮星在近红外颜色-星等图中的序列非常清晰，观测数据表现出较低的离散度。与ATMO、Sonora Elf Owl和Lacy & Burrows大气模型的比较显示了系统性差异，尤其是F105W-F125W和F105W-F160W颜色的预言偏红。低金属性模型在整体上拟合最佳，但仍存在物理过程缺失的问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高精度、内部一致数据集的重要性，揭示了当前大气模型未能完全捕捉Y矮星的物理和化学过程，为未来理论模型的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Y dwarfs represent the coldest class of brown dwarfs, with effective temperatures below 500K, and provide unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets. We present a large compilation of uniform near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters, including the F105W, F125W and F160W bands. We employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to reach photometric uncertainties at the 0.02-0.05 mag level for most targets. Combined with precise parallax measurements, our data reveal well-defined Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, observed with a markedly improved tightness. Known photometric trends emerge with minimal scatter, including the continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and the blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible hints of a reversal around 350K. Comparisons to the ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, and Lacy & Burrows atmospheric models highlight systematic discrepancies, in particular F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colours predicted to be too red. Low-metallicity grids provide the best fits to the global Y-dwarf population, although closer inspection across wavelengths shows that these preferences likely reflect compensating effects in missing or incomplete physics rather than true population-level abundances. While some atmospheric diversity is expected among Y dwarfs, their tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions reveal that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current grids. Our results underscore the importance of high-precision, internally consistent datasets in robustly tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures.

TL;DR: 研究分析了70个日冕洞的极性分布不对称性，发现88%的日冕洞磁场分布显著偏向单一极性，且磁场通量不平衡与高速太阳风速度呈中度相关（r=0.60）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究日冕洞的磁场极性分布及其不平衡性，探索其对高速太阳风生成的潜在影响。

Method: 使用HMI数据测量日冕洞下方光球层的视线磁场（B_LOS），通过偏度（S）和磁场通量不平衡（Φ_imb）量化不对称性，并与宁静太阳区对比。

Result: 日冕洞磁场分布显著不对称（S=±0.20~0.40，Φ_imb=20%~45%），且这种分布在半日自转周期内稳定；磁场通量不平衡与高速太阳风速度呈中度相关（r=0.60）。

Conclusion: 高磁场通量不平衡的开放磁场结构可能更利于等离子体加速形成高速太阳风，但其他因素也可能起重要作用。

Abstract: A study of the unbalanced magnetic polarity distribution of 70 coronal holes was performed. Data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) were used to examine the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$) beneath these coronal holes. The skewness ($S$) values of the $B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ distributions revealed significant asymmetry, characterized by the dominance of one magnetic polarity, with $\sim88\%$ of the coronal holes exhibiting a skewness value ranging from $\pm(0.20~\text{to}~0.40)$. The corresponding magnetic flux imbalance ($Φ_{\mathrm{imb}}$) ranges from $20\%$ to $45\%$. In contrast, quiet-Sun regions show symmetric magnetic field distributions with skewness values less than$~0.11$ and flux imbalance less than $11.0\%$. A study of a coronal hole as it traverses across the disk shows that the magnetic field distribution does not evolve significantly over this time, remaining stable across half a solar rotation. A moderate correlation ($r = 0.60$) between the magnetic flux imbalance and the speed of associated high speed solar wind streams ($v_{\mathrm{HSS}}$) suggests that flux imbalance may contribute to the generation of these faster solar wind streams. These results imply that regions with higher flux imbalance ($Φ_{\mathrm{imb}}$), indicative of more open magnetic field structures, present more favorable conditions for plasma acceleration as compared to closed bi-polar field, but the moderate correlation indicates that other factors may also play important roles.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Kepler-411恒星表面的星斑分布及其运动特性，为恒星磁活动机制提供了新的观测约束。

Abstract: Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation -- the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.

TL;DR: 论文研究了复现新星T Pyxidis的吸积与抛射质量关系，利用新技术测量轨道周期变化，证明其抛射质量远大于吸积质量，排除了其成为Ia型超新星前身星的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索T Pyxidis是否可能通过吸积足够质量成为Ia型超新星的前身星，解决传统测量方法中抛射质量不确定性大的问题。

Method: 采用新技术（轨道周期定时实验）测量1986至2025年间轨道周期的变化，计算抛射质量与吸积质量之比。

Result: 测得单次复现新星事件的抛射质量下限为＞2400×10⁻⁷ M⊙，整个爆发周期内抛射质量＞17120×10⁻⁷ M⊙，远超吸积质量220×10⁻⁷ M⊙。

Conclusion: T Pyxidis的抛射质量远大于吸积质量，无法积累足够质量成为Ia型超新星前身星，进一步支持了该系列研究中其他候选星体的类似结论。

Abstract: Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890--2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M_{\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $>$130$\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption. With simple and sure physics, the best estimate for the mass ejected by one RN event is $>$2400$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an extreme inviolate limit of $\gg$354$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over all eruptions in a cycle, $M_{ejecta}$$>$17120$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an inviolate limit of $M_{ejecta}$$\gg$2144$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over the full eruption cycle, the white dwarf accreted 220$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. So M$_{\rm ejecta}$$\gg$11.3$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, and T Pyx can never become a SNIa. This paper is the seventh in a series proving that each of various popular candidate SNIa progenitors cannot possibly evolve to a supernova; including V445 Pup, U Sco, T CrB, all symbiotic stars, FQ Cir, V1405 Cas, and now T Pyx.

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather as they propagate through the heliosphere. Many CMEs have associated prominence material entangled in their magnetic structure which contains cooler plasma. This cooler CME component contains significant amounts of neutral elements, which emit brightly in permitted atomic lines. It has been hypothesized that permitted transitions of neutral elements in eruptions could be used for inferring the magnetic field in CMEs, which is crucial for space weather forecasting. We present observations made with the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) in He I 1083 nm that clearly show the presence of neutral helium in eruptive prominences associated with CMEs as they propagate through the lower and middle corona. We find that solar prominence eruptions can be detected in He I 1083 nm observations up to the edge of the instrument field of view at about 2 solar radii, providing valuable spectral information that complements existing extreme ultraviolet and white-light coronal imaging observatories. These results illustrate the capability of UCoMP to probe the dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, allowing for their line-of-sight velocity estimation, and potentially improving space weather forecasting by enabling earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions.

Motivation: 研究VW Hydri的超级爆发行为，验证热-潮汐不稳定（TTI）模型的预测，并确定其系统参数。

Method: 使用TESS的120秒时间分辨率观测数据，分析光变曲线和超长周期演化，推算质量比和组分质量。

Result: 观测到前驱-降落形态的光变曲线；超长周期演化支持TTI模型；质量比q=0.131，组分质量M1≈0.6–1.0M⊙，M2≈0.08–0.14M⊙。

Conclusion: VW Hyi的系统参数验证了TTI模型在低质量比矮新星中的适用性，成为测试潮汐不稳定性模型的基准系统。

Abstract: We present 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova VW Hydri. Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107~min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \simeq 0.6$--$1.0\,M_\odot$ and $M_2 \simeq 0.08$--$0.14\,M_\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW~Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae.

Motivation: 研究太阳孔隙中的闪光现象是为了理解其光谱特性和动力学行为，特别是闪光对温度、速度和磁场的影响，以及其在光球层和色球层中的表现。

Method: 使用瑞典1米太阳望远镜的高分辨率观测数据（Fe I 6302 Å、Ca II 8542 Å、K线和H-β），并结合IRIS和SDO/AIA的(E)UV数据，采用双极分析和光谱反演（SIR和NICOLE）方法，推断温度、视线速度和磁场的分层结构。

Abstract: Solar pores are strongly magnetized regions lacking a photospheric penumbra and characterized by predominantly vertical magnetic fields. We present a multi-line study of flashes in a solar pore using high-resolution observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in Fe~\textsc{i}~6302~Å, Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~Å and K, and H-$β$, complemented by (E)UV data from \textit{IRIS} and \textit{SDO}/AIA. Bisector analysis and spectral inversions with \textsc{SIR} and \textsc{NICOLE} were used to infer stratifications of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic field. Flashes, confined to one half of the pore, exhibit cooler photospheric temperatures ($ΔT \approx 400$~K), stronger magnetic fields ($ΔB \approx 250$~G), larger inclinations ($\sim25^{\circ}$ versus $\sim18^{\circ}$), and persistent upflows ($\sim0.5$~km~s$^{-1}$) compared to the quiescent pore. They are co-spatial with enhanced 3- and 5-minute power in the photosphere, while only 3-minute power persists in the chromosphere. Flashes are detected down to $\sim50\%$ line depth in Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~Å intensity and show central chromospheric upflows ($\sim1$~km~s$^{-1}$) flanked by strong downflows ($\sim8$~km~s$^{-1}$). Temperature enhancements reach $\sim500$~K at $\logτ\approx -5$ and $\sim2500$~K at $\logτ\approx -6$, with a bimodal velocity distribution. Flashes correspond one-to-one with radially outward running waves near the pore boundary (5--15~km~s$^{-1}$). Strong Ca~\textsc{ii} core emission, occasional Stokes~$V$ reversals, and H-$β$ enhancements indicate that pore flashes are confined to the lower and mid-chromosphere, with little influence on higher atmospheric layers.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.

Abstract: Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow, and disk evolution. We present results from observations of the low luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}} \sim 0.2,L_{\odot}$) and low mass ($M_{*} \sim 0.15,M_{\odot}$) Class 0 protostar IRAS~16253$-$2429, conducted as part of the eDisk ALMA Large Program and the JWST Cycle~1 GO program IPA. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at $\leq 5,μ$m), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H$2$ transitions ($E{\mathrm{up}} = 1015$--21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. The outflow width traced by H$_2$~0-0~S(11) at the protostellar location measures $\leq 35$~au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters ($\sim 30$~au) but wider than the 20--23~au jet width in [Fe~II]. The opening angle narrows from 40--35 degrees for the low-$J$ H$_2$ lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component traced by ALMA $^{12}$CO to $\sim 28$--19 degrees for the high-$J$ H$_2$ lines (S(7)--S(11)). Position--velocity diagrams of H$2$ reveal higher velocities for higher $E{\mathrm{up}}$, ranging from $\sim 12.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to $\sim 28.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(5) and S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide-angle wind suggests a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to findings in other protostars and Class~II sources. The lower-velocity millimeter CO emission may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outward by the wide-angle wind along the cavity walls.

Method: 利用欧几里得太空任务拍摄的深空爆炸前图像，比较SN 2024vjm的前身系统亮度和已知的SN Iax前身星，并结合其观测特征进行分析。

Result: SN 2024vjm的前身系统比已知的SN Iax前身星更暗，可能由一个亚矮氦星作为质量供体；同时排除了大质量恒星起源的可能性，并发现其演化速度比明亮的SN Iax更慢。

Conclusion: SN 2024vjm支持白矮星爆炸起源模型，但其演化特征与常规SNe Ia的Phillips关系相反，表明SN Iax亚类的多样性可能需要更复杂的理论解释。

Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are well known for their role as standardizable cosmological candles. Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.

Abstract: Polarimetric interferometry is a powerful tool for probing both black hole accretion physics and the background spacetime. Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.

Motivation: 研究SSSs中WDs的引力波辐射特性，旨在揭示其内部磁场和自转的直接信息，并探索其作为Ia型超新星前身星的可能性。

Method: 利用MESA程序模拟WDs的质量、自旋和磁场结构的耦合演化，并用XNS程序计算四极形变，预测引力波信号的频率范围和强度。

Result: 研究显示，SSSs中的WDs（特别是接近钱德拉塞卡质量极限时）产生的连续引力波（CGWs）主要在deci-Hz波段，可被未来探测器（如DECIGO、BBO等）探测。已知的SSSs（如CAL~83和RX~J0019+2156）是可探测目标。

Conclusion: SSSs中的WDs是deci-Hz引力波探测的理想目标，其引力波信号可直接揭示WDs的内部磁场和自转状态，并为Ia型超新星前身星的识别提供依据。

Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) host white dwarfs (WDs) accreting at rates that sustain steady nuclear burning, driving rapid mass growth, radial contraction, and magnetic field amplification. Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with \texttt{MESA}, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver \texttt{XNS}. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end ofthermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM\,CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well-studied SSSs such as CAL~83 and RX~J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type~Ia progenitors.

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A based on two deep, narrow-band images covering the [Fe II] 1.644um + [Si I] 1.645um lines obtained in 2013 and 2020 with the same instruments on the UKIRT 3.8m telescope. The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant.

Abstract: Thermonuclear (Type I ) X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars offer a means to determine neutron-star (NS) mass ($M$) and radius ($R$) and thereby probe the properties of matter at supranuclear density. A subset of these events, photospheric radius-expansion (PRE) bursts, provide a particularly powerful tool to constrain the neutron-star $M$ and $R$. Here, we apply the direct cooling-tail method to 2S~0918$-$549, using a rare superexpansion burst observed by \emph{RXTE}. We fit only the post-touchdown data within \(F/F_{\rm td}\in[0.6,0.95]\), employing modern atmosphere models (pure He and metal-enriched). The pure-He atmosphere yields a good description of the cooling tail (\(χ^{2}/ν=18.12/14\)), whereas metal-rich models fail; information-criterion tests (AIC/BIC) disfavor adding a free absorption edge in every time bin, indicating that heavy-element ashes are unnecessary. The joint fit gives a distance \(d=4.1-5.3\) kpc and mass-radius constraints \(M=1-2\,M_\odot\) and \(R=9.7-11.9\) km (99\% confidence). These results suggest that representative families of both gravity-bound and self-bound equations of state remain viable at the $1σ$ confidence level.

Motivation: 探索GECAM探测到的同时事件（STE）的性质和起源，填补这一研究的空白。

Method: 首次对STE进行全面分析，包括形态、能量沉积及地磁坐标依赖性。

Result: STE可能由高能带电宇宙射线与卫星的直接相互作用引起，表明GECAM可作为微型宇宙射线天文台使用。

Conclusion: GECAM不仅能探测高能瞬变事件，还能识别和表征高能宇宙射线，扩展了其科学应用范围。

Abstract: GECAM is a constellation of all-sky monitors in hard X-ray and gamma-ray band primarily aimed at high energy transients such as gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, solar flares and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. As GECAM has the highest temporal resolution (0.1~$μ$s) among instruments of its kind, it can identify the so-called simultaneous events (STE) that deposit signals in multiple detectors nearly at the same time (with a 0.3~$μ$s window). However, the properties and origin of STE have not yet been explored. In this work, we implemented, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the STE detected by GECAM, including their morphology, energy deposition, and the dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates. We find that these STE probably result from direct interactions between high-energy charged cosmic rays and satellite. These results demonstrate that GECAM can detect, identify, and characterize high-energy cosmic rays, making it a Micro Cosmic-Ray Observatory (MICRO) in low Earth orbit.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究通过XMM-Newton观测分析了Seyfert星系Mrk 110的软X射线超额的时序和光谱特性，发现软X射线延迟现象，支持暖日冕和弱相对论反射的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨活跃星系核（AGNs）中2 keV以下软X射线超额的起源，特别是比较相对论反射和暖日冕解释的合理性。

Method: 利用XMM-Newton六次观测数据，进行频域延迟分析和光谱建模，结合提出的黑洞质量验证暖日冕和相对论反射的贡献。

Result: 探测到软X射线延迟现象，发射半径支持反射场景；暖日冕半径与吸积状态相关，反射分数持续较低。

Conclusion: 软X射线延迟可能同时由暖日冕和反射贡献，低反射分数表明存在外流内冕，与Mrk 110的喷流活动一致。

Abstract: The origin of the soft X-ray excess below 2 keV in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remains debated, with relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disk and warm Comptonization in an optically thick corona being the leading explanations. We investigate the timing and spectral properties of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 110 using six XMM-Newton observations. A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf < 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source.

TL;DR: INTEGRAL卫星从2002年10月17日发射至2025年2月28日结束科学任务，探索了伽马射线天空。由于分析的复杂性，大量数据尚未被充分研究。本文描述了IBIS望远镜Compton模式的在轨校准，分析了蟹状星云的光谱和偏振特性，并公开了Python库用于数据处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INTEGRAL卫星积累了超过20年的数据，但其Compton模式的分析因复杂性而未被充分研究。蟹状星云作为标准烛光，可用于仪器校准和高能天体物理研究。

Method: 使用INTEGRAL/IBIS望远镜的Compton模式，结合蟹状星云的数据进行校准，分析其光谱和偏振特性及其随时间的变化。

Result: 确定了IBIS Compton模式的光谱和偏振特性及其任务期间的演变，并测量了蟹状星云偏振的长期变化。成功探测到400 keV以上的偏振发射，为最高能量测量。

Conclusion: 通过Compton模式校准和分析，揭示了蟹状星云的高能偏振特性，并提供了公开工具支持后续研究。

Abstract: The INTEGRAL satellite explored the gamma-ray sky since its launch on October 17, 2002, and until the end of its scientific operation on February 28, 2025. A large fraction of the available data is still largely untouched, due to the complexity of analysis. We describe the latest in-flight calibration of the Compton mode of the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope, taking into account more than twenty years of data. The spectroscopy and polarization of the standard candle that is the Crab Nebula is analyzed in detail. We operate the IBIS telescope as a Coded mask Compton telescope, using the Crab Nebula to refine the calibration, as is usually done for high-energy instruments. We have determined the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of the IBIS Compton mode and their evolution along the entire duration of the mission. In addition, the long-term evolution of the Crab Nebula's polarization has been successfully measured and compared with other high-energy experiments. We could estimate the energy dependence of the Crab Nebula polarization in four bands between 200 keV and 1 MeV. In particular, the detection of polarized emissions strictly above 400 keV makes it the highest energy measurement ever performed for the Crab Nebula. A Python library was also made publicly available to analyze processed data.

TL;DR: 通过分析大麦哲伦云核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）遗迹J0450.4-7050的点对称形态，研究发现其由至少三对高能喷流塑造，支持‘抖动喷流爆炸机制’（JJEM）为CCSN的主要爆发机制。

Motivation: 探索CCSN遗迹的点对称形态成因，验证‘抖动喷流爆炸机制’（JJEM）是否为主要爆发机制，并与中微子驱动机制竞争。

Method: 通过多波段图像分析CCSNR J0450.4-7050的结构特征，识别点对称形态及其可能的成因。

Result: 发现遗迹的点对称形态由三对喷流塑造，与JJEM预测一致，中微子驱动机制无法解释此类形态。

Conclusion: 研究结果为JJEM作为CCSN主要爆发机制提供了强有力证据。

Abstract: By examining recently published images in different wavelengths, I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the Large Magellanic Cloud core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) J0450.4-7050 (SNR 0450-70.9; nicknamed Veliki), which I attribute to at least three pairs of energetic jets that participated in the explosion of the progenitor in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies. This study provides strong support for the claim that the JJEM is the primary CCSN explosion mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱引力透镜测量对宇宙学约束需要可靠的红移分布不确定性建模方法，以确保参数估计的准确性。

Method: 在罗马高纬度成像巡天（HLIS）项目中，通过优化PCA方法建模红移分布的不确定性，并与传统的均值偏移方法进行比较。

Result: 针对不同程度的红移分布偏差，PCA方法能有效减少S₈和Ωₘ的偏差，且参数效率高于均值偏移模型。

Conclusion: PCA方法在罗马空间望远镜的红移不确定性建模中表现出色，尤其适用于中度至强偏差情况。

Abstract: Cosmological constraints using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Roman Space Telescope will require a powerful method for modelling uncertainties in the galaxy redshift distribution. In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model.

Motivation: Subaru HSC观测到的微透镜事件可能由PBHs引起，但其起源尚不明确。本文旨在通过轴子曲率模型解释PBH的产生，并揭示其宇宙学意义。

Method: 采用两类轴子曲率模型，分析小尺度曲率摄动的增强效应，以此解释PBH的产生。

Result: 模型成功解释了HSC观测到的微透镜事件，并提出PBHs可能占据暗物质的$f_	ext{PBH} = \\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$比例。

Conclusion: 轴子曲率模型为PBH的观测提供合理解释，同时其预言的小尺度增强效应可能产生可探测的引力波信号。

Abstract: Recently, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations found 12 candidates for microlensing events. These events can be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6} M_\odot$ and a fraction of all dark matter of $f_\mathrm{PBH} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In this paper, we consider the PBH production in two types of the axionlike curvaton models, which predict an enhancement of the curvature perturbations on small scales. We show that the microlensing events can be explained in the axionlike curvaton model and discuss the cosmological implications such as gravitational waves.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于改进Lennard-Jones势的新型暴胀场景，能够在最小单场框架中生成极小的张量扰动振幅。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据对原初引力波的严格限制推动了暴胀模型的构建需求，尤其是能产生极低张量振幅的最小单场模型。

Method: 采用改进的Lennard-Jones势，结合平滑最小值和延伸平顶结构，支持慢滚暴胀并优雅退出，不引入额外自由度。

Result: 标量谱指数与CMB数据一致，张量-标量比极低（r∼10^-7），标量谱指数的运行也符合观测限制。

Conclusion: 该模型为最小单场暴胀提供了一种可行方案，显著抑制了张量扰动，与当前观测约束高度吻合。

Abstract: The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

*Bichu Li,Lei-Hua Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文通过非最小引力耦合扩展Running Curvaton模型，提出一种统一宇宙学框架，使有效状态方程能在quintessence到phantom区间自然演化，拟合DESI观测数据，同时保持早期宇宙描述能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DESI 2024等观测数据显示暗能量状态方程倾向于动态且跨越phantom divide（$w < -1$），这对标准$Λ$CDM模型和最小耦合标量场场景提出挑战。为解释这一现象并维持模型一致性，需提出新理论框架。

Method: 扩展Running Curvaton模型，引入非最小引力耦合项$ξχ^2 R$，通过Jordan框架实现状态方程动态演化。通过参数重调（$g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$）保持早期宇宙预测（如光谱指数$n_s$和非高斯性$f_{NL}$），并进行Horndeski框架下的稳定性分析。

Result: 模型能自然适应quintessence到phantom的状态方程变化，显著拟合DESI数据（$w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$），且不破坏早期宇宙预测（与Planck数据一致）。稳定性分析确认模型无幽灵和梯度不稳定性（$c_s^2 = 1$）。

Conclusion: 非最小耦合Running Curvaton模型提供了稳定、统一且符合最新观测的宇宙学描述，同时涵盖暴胀和晚期加速膨胀。

Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w < -1$). This finding challenges the standard $Λ$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $ξχ^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过高精度宇宙剪切测量，验证ΛCDM模型，并探讨IA和小尺度不确定性对结果的影响，为下一代研究奠定基础。

Method: 分析1.4亿个星系，分为四个红移区间，采用非线性排列（NLA）和潮汐排列加扭矩（TATT）模型，剔除小尺度数据以减小重子反馈影响。

Abstract: We present legacy cosmic shear measurements and cosmological constraints using six years of Dark Energy Survey imaging data. From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs.

The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\ell \in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3σ$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $ρ_{\ell}^{\rm tSZ \times CIB}$, finding $3.1σ$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\ell > 2500$. This result represents the deepest tSZ maps ever produced and provides new constraints that can help refine astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium.

### [33] [Limits on the Post-eclipse Emission Spectrum of HD 80606 b From High-Resolution Spectroscop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09129)
*Luke Finnerty,Aurora Kesseli,Kyle Pearson,Charles Beichman,Michael P. Fitzgerald*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过对HD 80606 b的Keck/NIRSPEC K波段观测，结合高分辨率交叉相关光谱分析，初步探测到该行星信号，支持了JWST的部分发现，但需更高分辨率观测进一步确认。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HD 80606 b在大气层经历快速加热和极端化学变化时的特性，以验证JWST的观测结果并探索其大气成分。

Method: 利用Keck/NIRSPEC进行K波段观测，结合高分辨率交叉相关光谱分析（HRCCS）和大气反演技术。

Result: 初步探测到HD 80606 b信号（SNR~4），排除强热反转假设；大气反演显示CH₄和CO吸收特征，与JWST结果一致。

Conclusion: 现有数据支持JWST对HD 80606 b的观测结果，但需更高分辨率或更广波长覆盖的观测以确证大气成分。

Abstract: We present Keck/NIRSPEC $K$-band observations of HD 80606 b, one of the most eccentric known exoplanets. HD 80606 b was observed after secondary eclipse, close to periastron, when the planet passes within 0.03 AU of HD 80606 and the rapid heating of the atmosphere may lead to extreme chemical changes and a temporary thermal inversion. The rapid change in the planetary radial velocity near periastron is sufficient to enable high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) analysis, which produces a tentative detection ($\rm SNR\sim4$) of HD 80606 b. Injection-recovery tests appear to reject strong thermal inversions near periastron, consistent with recent results from JWST. We also perform atmospheric retrievals with free parameters for the Pressure-Temperature ($P-T$) profile and with a profile matched to the JWST results, which suggest the presence of absorption features from CH$_4$ and CO. While HD 80606 b is not definitively detected in these data, these results are consistent with JWST observations, which found the post-eclipse atmosphere of HD 80606 b shows weak absorption features from these species. Future observations with higher spectral resolution and/or wider wavelength coverage are needed for a confident atmospheric detection of HD 80606 b via high-resolution spectroscopy alone, but such observations are a challenge to schedule due to the 111-day orbital period.

Method: 通过数值模拟分析了土卫六的轨道扩张如何通过共振作用影响土星的倾斜和土卫七的形成，并提出了一个假设性事件链（“Proto-Hyperion”的碰撞）。

Result: 数值模拟证明这一事件链具有较高概率，并能合理解释土星系统的观测特征，如土卫七的形成、土卫八（Iapetus）的轨道倾角及内卫星系统的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究为土星系统的近期演化提供了一个统一的理论框架，解释了环和卫星的形成与演化过程，强调了土卫六轨道扩张的核心作用。

Abstract: The age of the rings and some of the moons of Saturn is an open question, and multiple lines of evidence point to a recent (few hundred Myr ago) cataclysm involving disruption of past moons. The main driver of the evolution of the Saturnian system is the relatively rapid tidal expansion of its largest moon, Titan, which is likely driven by resonant tides within Saturn. The obliquity of Saturn and the orbit of the small moon Hyperion both serve as a record of the past orbital evolution of Titan. Saturn's obliquity was likely generated by a secular spin-orbit resonance with the planets, while Hyperion is caught in a mean-motion resonance with Titan, with both phenomena driven by Titan's orbital expansion. We propose that the breaking of Saturn's spin resonance was also the event in which Hyperion formed, when an outer mid-sized satellite (``Proto-Hyperion'') was destabilized and collided with Titan, with some of the debris accreting into Hyperion. During the instability Proto-Hyperion's perturbations produced the observed orbital inclination of Iapetus. The same event also excited the eccentricity of Titan, which then, through Titan's resonant interaction with the inner moons, led to destabilization, collisional disruption and re-accretion of the inner moon system, including the rings. We present numerical integrations that show that this chain of events has a relatively high probability, and discuss how it fits within our knowledge of the Saturnian system.

TL;DR: 利用JWST/NIRSpec IFU观测HR 8799系统的四颗巨行星，探测其大气成分并分析形成过程。发现碳氧富集相似，硫含量随轨道距离增加而增加，行星b富含氮气，支持其形成于CO和N₂雪线之间的假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HR 8799系统的四颗巨行星为研究行星形成和原行星盘成分分布提供了独特机会，新观测旨在揭示其大气成分和形成机制。

Method: 使用JWST/NIRSpec IFU观测（2.85-5.3 μm），结合1-5 μm测光数据，并进行大气反演，考虑非平衡化学和云层影响。

Result: 探测到CO、CH₄、H₂O、H₂S、CO₂（行星b含NH₃），碳氧富集为3-5倍恒星值，硫含量随轨道距离增加（2-5倍恒星），行星b氮含量显著（21.2倍恒星）。

Conclusion: 行星b形成于CO和N₂雪线之间，内行星在CO雪线内形成；硫含量趋势与固体吸积模型一致，支持星子或卵石吸积范式（2×MMSN）。

Abstract: With four giant planets ($m\sim5-10~M_{\rm Jup}$, $T_\rm{eff}\sim900-1200$ K) orbiting between 15-70 au, HR 8799 provides an unparalleled testbed for studying giant planet formation and probing compositional trends across the protoplanetary disk. We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations ($2.85-5.3~μ$m, $R\approx2700$) that now include the spectrum of HR 8799 b, and higher S/N spectra for HR 8799 c, d, and e compared to that in Ruffio & Xuan et al. 2026. We detect CO, CH$_4$, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CO$_2$, and for planet b, NH$_3$. We combine the NIRSpec spectra with $1-5 μ$m photometry to perform atmospheric retrievals that account for disequilibrium chemistry and clouds, and allow C/H, O/H, N/H, and S/H to scale independently. While the four planets are similarly enriched in carbon and oxygen, with C/H and O/H between $3-5\times$ stellar, we observe a tentative trend of increasing S/H - a tracer of refractory solids - from $2-5 \times$ stellar with increasing orbital distance. From HR 8799 b's NH$_3$ abundance, we estimate $\rm N/H=21.2^{+16.2}_{-8.8}\times$ stellar, suggesting the outer planet accreted significant amounts of N-rich gas. Overall, the elemental abundance patterns we observe are consistent with a picture where planet b formed between the CO snowline and the more-distant N$_2$ snowline, while the inner planets accreted $3 \times$ stellar CO-enriched disk gas within the CO snowline. The excess volatile mass from pebble drift and evaporation implies an integrated pebble flux of $750 \pm 200~M_{\oplus}$. The increase in the planets' S/H with orbital distance implies more solid accretion further out, which is quantitatively compatible with expectations from both pebble and planetesimal accretion ($2 \times$ Minimum Mass Solar Nebula) paradigms.

Motivation: 研究高红移星系团的先驱对宇宙再电离的作用，并解决此前依赖LAEs探测的局限性。

Method: 使用基于JWST-ALT调查的NIRCam光谱数据和FoF算法，识别和分析星系过密度区的性质。

Conclusion: 研究为再电离时代星系团的物理性质提供了直接观测约束，强调了多波段探测的重要性。

Abstract: The high-redshift progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters are believed to substantially contribute to the global star-formation rate density and drive the large-scale reionization of the Universe. Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$α$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$α$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \hi\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z>5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大质量黑洞在早期宇宙（ΛCDM模型）中的生长机制及其反馈效应对宿主星系的影响。

Method: 使用SEEDZ模拟，分析黑洞的超爱dington吸积过程及反馈作用。

Result: 黑洞初始生长被自身反馈切断，反馈能量超过宿主星系结合能，导致气体被抛射。高红移下黑洞质量上限为10^6 M⊙。

Conclusion: 黑洞反馈在早期宇宙中的作用可能较弱，或宿主星系通过两步过程（先淬灭后重建）形成。质量上限由反馈模型和宿主星系势决定。

Abstract: Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\sim10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.

Motivation: 探究RQ-NLSy1星系的非热辐射成分及其对光谱能量分布的贡献。

Method: 结合ZTF的高时间分辨率光学光变数据、WISE的MIR光变数据及宽波段SED建模，量化变异性并分析其来源。

Result: 光学变异性与爱丁顿比率负相关，与黑洞质量正相关；部分源表现出非热辐射特征和MIR-光学滞后现象。

Conclusion: RQ-NLSy1星系中可能存在间歇性喷流，需多波段协同观测进一步验证。

Abstract: Radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s) are generally considered to be dominated by thermal emission from the accretion disk. However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations.

Motivation: AQUAL和GRAS理论在星系动力学中表现良好，但无法解释星系团中的缺失质量问题，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种修改的GRAS/AQUAL场方程，仅含一个自由参数，并将其应用于星系团样本，同时检验其与星系模型和太阳系约束的兼容性。

Result: 修改后的场方程在星系团中表现良好，同时解释了星系RAR与星系团RAR之间的差异。

Conclusion: 修改的GRAS/AQUAL场方程为解决星系团缺失质量问题提供了新途径，同时保持了与星系动力学的良好一致性。

Abstract: The MONDian theory of AQUAL (AQUAdratic Lagrangian) and the theory of GRAS (GRavitational Anti-Screening) are alternatives to the theory of dark matter. When these theories are applied to galaxy dynamics they are in excellent agreement with observations including the galactic RAR (Radial Acceleration Relationship). However, when applied to galaxy clusters they do not explain the bulk of the missing mass. This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters.

Motivation: 探讨银河系隆起区中暗物质（如原初黑洞）与恒星残骸（如白矮星）碰撞的物理机制及其对触发Ia型超新星的潜在影响，旨在通过理论模型和未来观测验证这一假说。

Method: 通过详细物理模型分析原初黑洞撞击白矮星时的动能热化过程，考虑引力聚焦效应和简并核心的比热，评估其对核心温度的提升程度。

Result: 模型表明，月球质量的原初黑洞撞击白矮星可能导致核心温度至少升高一度，且实际升温可能更高。现有观测对Ia型超新星径向分布的结论尚不明确。

Conclusion: 未来Rubin望远镜的百万级超新星样本将有望验证碰撞触发机制是否导致Ia型超新星分布更集中于星系中心。

Abstract: Collisions between stellar remnants and dark matter in the Galactic bulge are frequent, and the kinetic energy of a primordial black hole incident on a white dwarf, if it is all thermalized, will raise the degenerate core's temperature, by at least a degree in the case of a lunar mass black hole. This is an underestimate in two ways: the specific heat is less than 3k/2 per particle, and the incoming object is accelerated by gravitational focusing. Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that.

Motivation: 了解PSB星系的性质及其在星系演化中的作用，尤其是从恒星形成到静止的转变。

Method: 使用MaNGA、CALIFA和AMUSING++的IFS数据，通过Pipe3D分析管道测量SFH，直接根据SFH选择PSB星系和区域，避免了传统方法对AGN的偏见。

Result: 筛选出107个PSB星系，仅7个与传统方法重叠；未发现显著的Seyfert 2 PSB种群；识别出多种PSB区域分布模式（如中心集中、环状、广泛分布）。

Conclusion: 新方法有效扩展了PSB星系的识别范围，揭示了多样化的PSB区域形态，表明强AGN活动在PSB阶段不常见。

Abstract: Post-StarBurst (PSB) galaxies are galaxies that have undergone a large burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching. Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.

Conclusion: 观测结果表明，盘磁场线的不对称质量加载可能是单极性喷流形成的最合理解释。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in star formation is understanding how a protostar accretes mass from its circumstellar disk while removing excess angular momentum. Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity.

Conclusion: HI吸收检测率受射电源演化状态、物理条件和气体结构的综合影响，结果与低红移类似，揭示了HI吸收的多重可能性。

Abstract: We present MeerKAT observations searching for HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}> 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25<z<0.7$). The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\%\pm 7\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 该研究通过N体模拟评估年轻大质量星团（YMC）演化为年老疏散星团（OC）对引力波（GW）双星合并事件的贡献。模拟结果显示，GW合并效率和特征与LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA观测到的部分关键特征一致。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨GW双星合并的多重形成通道之一，特别是YMC/OC通道在GW合并事件中的作用。

Method: 使用N体代码NBODY7模拟了90个星团的演化，考虑了星团质量、半径和金属丰度的多样性，并包含初始双星、黑洞和中性星的形成、自旋及引力波反冲等物理过程。

Result: 模拟结果显示，GW合并效率随星团质量变化非单调，且模型能重现观测中的不对称低质量合并、高自旋黑洞事件等特征，但低估了10倍太阳质量黑洞的贡献。

Conclusion: YMC/OC通道贡献了25%-33%的观测GW合并率，但其他通道的存在仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]

Abstract: We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.

Result: 测得HCOOH的柱密度为$(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$，激发温度为$120\pm15$ K，丰度比为$t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH = $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$。化学模型表明HCOOH可通过HCO与OH在尘埃表面反应生成。

Conclusion: 观测与模型结果高度一致，验证了HCOOH的形成机制，并为星际介质中复杂有机分子的化学演化提供了新见解。

Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.

Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.

Abstract: In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.

Conclusion: 高金属丰度区域可能与星系臂的物理条件（如电离星团温度变化或初始质量函数差异）相关，揭示了恒星形成环境的空间不均匀性。

Abstract: We present here two H II region catalogues with azimuthal resolution for the two grand design galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946. With the help of these catalogues, we study several properties of the star-forming processes occurring in spiral galaxies. We obtained direct imaging in the narrow-band filters centred at Hα, H\b{eta}, [O II]λ3727, and [O III]λλ4959, 5007 and their respective continua. After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions.

Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$>=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.

Abstract: The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.

Abstract: We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) using data from the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM), by applying the recently developed LVM Data Analysis Pipeline (LVM-DAP). Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures.

Abstract: Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism.
