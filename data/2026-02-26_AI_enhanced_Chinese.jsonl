Accepted by SCPMA", "summary": "Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\\rm cyc}$-$P_{\\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u5f62\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5927\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5468\u671f\u8d8a\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u5bf9\u6d41\u51cf\u5f31\u548c\u8f83\u5dee\u65cb\u8f6c\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7403\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d8\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u53d8\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u53d8\u53d8\u661f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u53d8\u5f62M\u77ee\u661f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u5bf9\u70ed\u5bf9\u6d41\u548c\u8f83\u5dee\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u6052\u661f\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u70ed\u5bf9\u6d41\u548c\u8f83\u5dee\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u51cf\u5f31\u53ef\u80fd\u5ef6\u957f\u78c1\u573a\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d8\u5f62\u6052\u661f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5468\u671f\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Removing the dependency on the sound horizon with a rescaling procedure at the matter power spectrum level, we analyse the BOSS full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum (for the first time) using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to one loop. We combine this analysis with the auto- and cross-angular power spectra from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, the $3 \\times 2$pt analysis from DES Y3, and the CMB gravitational lensing power spectrum from Planck PR3. Our baseline analysis, that does not rely on supernovae data, yields $h = 0.702^{+0.022}_{-0.024}$, $\u03a9_m = 0.310 \\pm 0.013$, and $\u03c3_8 = 0.799 \\pm 0.020$, corresponding to $3-4 \\%$ precision measurements. When adding supernovae data from Pantheon+, we obtain a $2.6 \\%$ measurement of $h$, with $h = 0.686 \\pm 0.018$. We further note that our EFTBOSS analysis indicates a slight deviation of the BAO scale parameter (at $1.8 \u03c3$) from its $\u039b$CDM value, caused by the small scales of the bispectrum. We finally use the sound horizon-free EFTBOSS analysis as a diagnosis for the presence of new physics, finding that our results are consistent with the recent hints of evolving dark energy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$\u03bc$m and 4.6 $\u03bc$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0NGC 6447\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u4eae\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u4eae\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u4ece\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AGN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u906e\u853d\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u6d88\u6563\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AGN\u4ece\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u906e\u853d\u7269\u8d28\u6d88\u6563\u4e0eAGN\u9732\u51fa\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528WISE/NEOWISE\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001ASAS-SN\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5149\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u3001SPHEREx\u5149\u8c31\u548cNuSTAR\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790NGC 6447\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u4eae\u5ea614\u5e74\u95f4\u589e\u52a01.2\u661f\u7b49\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u4e3a8.4\u00d710^41 erg/s\uff0c\u652f\u6301AGN\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u4f30\u7b97AGN\u5438\u79ef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a10^4-10^6\u5e74\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u671f\u7ea2\u5916\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u662f\u63a2\u6d4bAGN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0cNGC 6447\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3AGN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}
