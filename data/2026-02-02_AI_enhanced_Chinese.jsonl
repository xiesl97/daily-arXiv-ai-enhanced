However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($<100 \\rm \\ pc$) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim 2\\times10^5 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ black holes residing in $M_\\star \\gtrsim 2\\times10^7 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u5438\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684AGN\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c14\u4f53\u53cd\u590d\u758f\u6563\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6b64\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u592e\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684AGN\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbFIRE-2\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u9a71\u52a8\u5438\u79ef\uff08GTDA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u81ea\u7531\u843d\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u5e76\u9884\u6d4bAGN\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6AGN\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5373AGN\u5904\u4e8e\u8d85\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u72b6\u6001\u4e14\u53d7\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5149\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684AGN\u4e30\u5ea6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6AGN\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Submitted to A&A, comments are welcome", "summary": "The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta -- indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight -- but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u53d1\u73b0\u7684AGN\u65b0\u79cd\u7fa4\u5206\u4e3a'\u5c0f\u7ea2\u70b9'\uff08LRDs\uff09\u548c'\u5c0f\u84dd\u70b9'\uff08LBDs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u7684\u5178\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fbAGN\u7684\u6307\u6570\u578bBalmer\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u51faX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f31\u3001\u5f3a[OIII]4363\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u5f31\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\u3002\u4e24\u7c7b\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6AGN\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5468\u56f4\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22JWST\u53d1\u73b0\u7684AGN\u65b0\u79cd\u7fa4\uff08LRDs\u548cLBDs\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5AGN\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u5178\u578bLRD\uff08GN-28074\uff09\u548cLBD\uff08GS-3073\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\uff08Balmer\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3001[OIII]4363\u7b49\uff09\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u7c7bAGN\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u578bBalmer\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f31\u3001\u5f3a[OIII]4363\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u8bca\u65ad\uff08HeII4686\u7ebf\uff09\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08Balmer\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\uff09\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LRDs\u548cLBDs\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6AGN\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u6e90\u4e8e\u5468\u56f4\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5438\u79ef\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Several studies have also investigated the orientation of nuclear dust features. We follow up on this previous work with newer Hubble Space Telescope imaging of early-type radio galaxies, and a largely automated process for measuring position angles. We classify the dust features as lanes, disks, or rings. Lanes are irregular structures that likely form from gas-rich minor mergers, while disks and rings are more well-defined and may form from settling lanes or internal mechanisms. We find that dust lanes do not have a preferred alignment relative to their host galaxies, but are preferentially perpendicular to the jets. In contrast, dust disks and rings tend to be closely aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies, but have varying orientations relative to the jets. Our results suggest that infalling dusty material from mergers can influence the angle of the radio jet. This would allow the jet orientation to change over time, and may help explain the role of AGN feedback in maintaining quiescence in massive galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c18\u57c3\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6761\u5e26\u3001\u76d8\u72b6\u6216\u73af\u72b6\uff09\u4e0e\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u53ca\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u53d6\u5411\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c18\u57c3\u6761\u5e26\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0e\u55b7\u6d41\u5782\u76f4\uff0c\u800c\u76d8\u72b6\u548c\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u4e3b\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u55b7\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u5c18\u57c3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u53d6\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u5c18\u57c3\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6761\u5e26\u3001\u76d8\u72b6\u6216\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5c18\u57c3\u6761\u5e26\u65e0\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u53d6\u5411\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u55b7\u6d41\u5782\u76f4\uff1b\u76d8\u72b6\u548c\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u4e3b\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u76f8\u5bf9\u53d6\u5411\u591a\u53d8\u3002\u8868\u660e\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u55b7\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91caAGN\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u9759\u6b62\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

They represent extreme examples of misaligned systems and provide valuable insight into galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and peculiar gas dynamics. We compile a complete sample of kinematically confirmed PRGs and collect their H I measurements. Combining literature data with new observations from FAST, we detect H I emission in 22 sources, identify one potential H I absorption feature, and find four non-detections among 40 confirmed PRGs. Compared to galaxies in the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, PRGs predominantly occupy the green valley or quenched regimes but exhibit higher gas fractions than typical early-type galaxies, suggesting gas accretion. The H I profile asymmetry and shape for PRGs are not consistent with that of the ALFALFA sample with p<0.05. We examine their Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and baryonic TFR (bTFR), linking the systems' rotation velocities to their masses.

Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5\u00b0 can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6052\u661f\u98de\u63a0\u53ef\u5bf9\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u7fd8\u66f2\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86RW Aur\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u98de\u63a0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u76d8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7fd8\u66f2\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u5219\u8f83\u77ed\u547d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\u7fd8\u66f2\u73b0\u8c61\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u98de\u63a0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eRW Aur\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd9\u4e00\u98de\u63a0\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u76d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u98de\u63a0\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u539f\u76d8\u9762\u7684\u503e\u659c\u53ef\u6fc0\u53d1\u51e0\u5ea6\u7684\u7fd8\u66f2\uff0c\u7fd8\u66f2\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u98de\u63a0\u5177\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u6001\uff1b\u7fd8\u66f2\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u8f83\u77ed\u547d\u3002RW Aur\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u6fc0\u53d1\u7ea65\u00b0\u7684\u7fd8\u66f2\uff0c\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u5df2\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6052\u661f\u98de\u63a0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7fd8\u66f2\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002RW Aur\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u786e\u8ba4\u3002"}}

No figures", "summary": "We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\u039b$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\u03c3_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\u039b$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints.

We visually classify their host galaxy morphologies and compute their bulge-to-total light ratios using the software Galaxy Shapes of Light (galight). Most (94 percent) GOODS AGN exhibit obscured SEDs, defined by diminished ultraviolet and/or mid-infrared emission, while only 6 percent show unobscured, quasar-like SEDs. Secular processes appear to play a large role in stimulating AGN emission, as only around one-third of galaxies are undergoing interactions.

Our findings are in general agreement with earlier studies that suggest magnetic deflection angles > 90 degrees are very unlikely to occur in sub-Alfvenic regimes. We find that their upper limit exhibits an identifiable trend with the Alfven Mach number Ma, suggesting that gradual steepening of Alfvenic deflections with increasing Ma is a plausible mechanism controlling deflection angles in the young solar wind. Further analysis reveals that large velocity fluctuations tend to be important in the largest sub-Alfvenic magnetic deflections with increasing contributions from the parallel component very close to Ma = 1, while virtually no magnetic deflections in the super-Alfvenic regime exhibit such large velocity perturbations. We also determine the local ratio of radial Poynting flux SR to kinetic energy flux KR and find that large sub-Alfvenic deflection angles tend to be dominated by SR, while super-Alfvenic deflections are eventually dominated by the KR associated with the radial solar wind flow. Our results show that within the vicinity of the Alfven surface (where Ma = 1), there is a critical region of parameter space within which velocity deflections approach the Alfven velocity and KR/SR is close to unity. We refer to this region (where | log10(Ma)| < 0.2) as the conversion layer.

In particular, the near-infrared (NIR) spectral domain offers an increased RV sensitivity and potentially reduced stellar activity signals. Howevern precise NIR RV measurements can be strongly affected by telluric absorption lines from the Earth's atmosphere.\n  We searched for planets orbiting Gl 725 B, a nearby late-M dwarf at $3.5$ pc, using high-precision SPIRou RV observations. We assessed the impact of telluric contamination and evaluated the performance of the weighted principal component analysis reconstruction method (WAPITI), designed to mitigate these systematics and improve planet detectability.\n  Using synthetic and observational SPIRou data, we simulated telluric effects on RVs under varying barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) conditions and applied WAPITI to correct line-by-line RVs. The method was tested through injection-recovery experiments and applied to real SPIRou observations of Gl 725 B.\n  WAPITI efficiently corrects telluric contamination in simulated and real datasets, enhancing the detectability and accuracy of planetary signals.

Optical efficiency was validated through simulations and laser testing. Destructive window removal allowed for detailed structural analysis, confirming the elimination of central vias present in previous models. We measured a contrast ratio of 250:1, currently limited by the evaluation board's duty cycle rather than the DMD itself. Furthermore, we successfully simulated artificial planetary transits, recovering depths ranging from gas giants to a 40 ppm rocky planet transit.

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $\u03b3$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u660e\u4eae\u7684\u51b7\u6838\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\uff08CR\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u70ed\u8c31X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u53ca\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51b7\u6838\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e3a\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u591a\u9879\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9006\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u5bf9X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5c04\u7535\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "CR-IC\u8f90\u5c04\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u70ed\u8c31X\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u51b7\u6838\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5c04\u7535-X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "CR-IC\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u51b7\u6838\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u9879\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u5c06\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \\, \u03c3$ to $2 \\, \u03c3$.

In this Letter, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the optical to the infrared for 1,328 candidates, incorporating GALEX ultraviolet photometry to assess the presence of hidden hot companions. We quantify ultraviolet excess by comparing observed near-ultraviolet fluxes with single-star SED predictions and further test whether excesses can be explained by non-degenerate stellar companions for sources exhibiting moderate excess. We additionally examine the Galactic kinematics of the sample to identify systems potentially affected by natal kicks during compact-object formation.

James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\\sim0.1~M\\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\\sim10^{29}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u56f4\u7ed5\u6781\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\uff08VLMS\uff09\u7684\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u4e2d\u78b3\u6c22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5185\u533a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u78b3\u6c27\u6bd4\uff08C/O\uff09\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u7ec4\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9VLMS\u5468\u56f4\u76d8\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfM\u77ee\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u5185\u76d8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cC/O\u6bd4\uff080.44\u81f387.47\uff09\u4e0b\u78b3\u6c22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u548c\u542b\u6c27\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u78b3\u6c22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9C/O\u6bd4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u78b3\u589e\u52a02\u500d\u6216\u6c27\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\u65f6\u3002IR\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574C/O\u6bd4\u91cd\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u6052\u661fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u4eae\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eVLMS\u5468\u56f4\u5185\u76d8\u7684\u78b3\u6c22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u5b66\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u7684C/O\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u4eae\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

The surface brightness image is bimodal, elongated east-west with a projected core separation of $\\sim 1.35$ Mpc. We measure gas temperatures of 5.36 keV for the eastern subcluster (PSZ-E) and 5.44 keV for the western component (PSZ-W). Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\\log(M_{500}/M_\\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\\sim 1:1.7$. PSZ-E shows X-ray concentration indices of $c_{40}/c_{400}=0.124$ and $c_{100}/c_{500}=0.278$, together with a centroid shift of $w=0.016$, indicating a disturbed halo that still hosts a compact cool core; PSZ-W is comparably disturbed even in its core. Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2PSZ2 G279.79+39.09\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u53cc\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4e1c\u897f\u5411\u5ef6\u4f38\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5206\u79bb\u7ea61.35 Mpc\u3002\u5b50\u56e2PSZ-E\u548cPSZ-W\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u6e29\u5ea6\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a1:1.7\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u56fe\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u6838\u5fc3\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u9ad8\u538b\u6865\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76PSZ2 G279.79+39.09\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u5265\u79bb\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528XMM-Newton\u548cChandra\u7684\u5b58\u6863\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u9759\u6c34\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u53ca\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u6838\u5fc3\u3001\u9ad8\u6e29\u6865\u53ca\u5f31\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\uff08\u9a6c\u8d6b\u6570~1.41\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u6838\u5fc3\u63a5\u8fd1\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5408\u5e76\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u63a5\u8fd1\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u540e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u4e14\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u652f\u6301\u524d\u8fd1\u5fc3\u70b9\u60c5\u666f\u3002"}}

Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics 23rd January 2026", "summary": "Mass loss through stellar jets is closely tied to the process of accretion through the disk. Understanding phenomena such as episodic ejections and outflow asymmetries can thus shed light on the mechanism of jet launching and its connection to both mass accretion and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We use new VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode observations of the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28 to map the jet structures within 6'' of the source at an effective angular resolution of 0.''12, provided by the combination of the AO correction and image deconvolution. The emission line profiles and flux ratios are investigated and diagnostic analysis of the optical forbidden emission lines (FELs) is used to estimate the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and shock velocities in both jet lobes within 200 au of the star. The mass outflow rates in each lobe are obtained using the derived total densities and FEL luminosities and compared with the mass accretion rate. We identify several new knots in both jet lobes which have been ejected in the previous 10 years on a timescale of 3-6 years, which is significantly more frequent than previously estimated. In both lobes we find comparable mass outflow rates close to the jet base. Th 28 has undergone a significant rise in mass accretion rate between 2014 and 2023, which may be linked to the most recently ejected knot pair detected in each side of the jet. The red-shifted jet mass outflow rate shows a similar increase of a factor 2, indicating that the ratio of mass outflow to accretion remains constant. A moderately lower mass outflow rate is found in the faster blue-shifted lobe, supporting the possibility that momentum ejection is conserved on each side of the jet. The frequent knot ejections indicate that this source is a good target for further monitoring to study the accretion-ejection connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86T Tauri\u661fTh 28\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u55b7\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u8d28\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u55b7\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u55b7\u6d41\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528VLT/MUSE\u7a84\u573a\u6a21\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4bTh 28\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u7981\u6212\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u5256\u9762\u548c\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u4e86\u55b7\u6d41\u53f6\u7247\u5185\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7535\u79bb\u5206\u6570\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u55b7\u6d41\u53f6\u7247\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u7ed3\uff0c\u55b7\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u6b64\u524d\u4f30\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u8d28\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u57282014\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7ea2\u79fb\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u7387\u4e5f\u76f8\u5e94\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u800c\u84dd\u79fb\u55b7\u6d41\u635f\u5931\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "conclusion": "Th 28\u662f\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u55b7\u6d41\u7ed3\u55b7\u5c04\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u76d1\u6d4b\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u5438\u79ef-\u55b7\u5c04\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6c22\u6c26\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u4e0d\u6df7\u6eb6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c22\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53-\u91d1\u5c5e\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08IMT\uff09\u53d7\u6c26\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6728\u661f\u548c\u571f\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c22\u6c26\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3001\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6728\u661f\u548c\u571f\u661f\u7b49\u6c14\u6001\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u5b9a\u5176\u4e0d\u6df7\u6eb6\u8fb9\u754c\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece\u5934\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c22\u6c26\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53-\u91d1\u5c5e\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08IMT\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6c26\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6c22\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53-\u91d1\u5c5e\u8f6c\u53d8\u5728\u5c0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6c26\u63ba\u6742\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728150 GPa\u538b\u529b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e0eH2\u5206\u5b50\u89e3\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6c22\u6c26\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6c22\u4f4e2\u81f3\u51e0\u5343\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c22\u6c26\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684IMT\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6728\u661f\u548c\u571f\u661f\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e24\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $<10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\\lesssim2\\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin.

In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event.

Precise physical parameters of the stellar components together with systematic measurements of the periastron advance are needed. We present new results of our long-term observational project to analyze the apsidal motion in early-type eccentric eclipsing binaries. New ground and space-based photometric data were obtained, and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of two detached southern-hemisphere eclipsing binaries: V1647 Sgr (P=3.28 d, e=0.41), and V2283 Sgr (3.47, 0.49). Their TESS observations in four sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values were obtained for the elements of apsidal motion. Using archival spectroscopy for V1647 Sgr, the precise absolute parameters were improved: M1 = 2.184(0.035) M$_\\odot$, M2 = 1.957(0.035) M$_\\odot$, and R1 = 1.839(0.015) R$_\\odot$, R2 = 1.716(0.015) R$_\\odot$. For V2283 Sgr the absolute dimensions were newly estimated: M1 = 2.178(0.10) M$_\\odot$, M2 = 1.547(0.10) M$_\\odot$, and R1 = 1.796(0.01) R$_\\odot$, R2 = 1.544(0.01) R$_\\odot$. We improved relatively long periods of apsidal motion of about 580 and 530 years, together with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.394, and -2.418, for V1647 Sgr and V2283 Sgr, respectively. The relativistic contribution to apsidal motion is not negligible, making about 12 resp. 14% of the total rate of apsidal motion.

JWST observations suggest a carbon-dominated atmosphere (CO$_2$/CO) over a global magma ocean ($>$3000 K). We suggest that any CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with trace H$_2$O/O$_2$, likely arises from outgassing of its initial volatile reservoir. As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\\sim$10 Myr. With both at 10 wt%, greenhouse warming alone can prolong outgassing up to $\\sim$30 Myr. Our model shows that tidal heating can reduce the volatile threshold required to maintain a high surface temperature ($\\sim$3200 K at $e = 0.005$) and delay outgassing of additional volatiles to the present-day. However, higher tidal heating presents a tradeoff between prolonging tenuous outgassing and enlarging the overall size of the secondary atmosphere. Tidally-enhanced outgassing may produce minor pressure variations that could contribute to the observed phase-curve variability. Additionally, our model shows that tidal heating strongly controls outgassing in the planet's young-to-midlife stage, then shifts toward a volatile inventory dependence at mature ages. Using 55 Cnc e, we present a framework to prioritize atmosphere detections on rocky ultra short period (USP) magma ocean planets, linking age-dependent tidal heating and volatile inventory to the formation and size of secondary atmospheres.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8655 Cancri e\u8fd9\u9897\u5ca9\u77f3\u884c\u661f\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u5ca9\u6d46\u6d77\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u6e29\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94\u5ef6\u957f\u8131\u6c14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u4f18\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d85\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u5ca9\u6d46\u6d77\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e355 Cancri e\u7b49\u8d85\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u5ca9\u77f3\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5ca9\u6d46\u6d77\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u884c\u661f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u50a8\u5c42\u7684\u8131\u6c14\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u6e29\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u7ef4\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6e29\u7684\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u9608\u503c\u5e76\u5ef6\u957f\u8131\u6c14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u5e74\u8f7b\u5230\u4e2d\u5e74\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8131\u6c14\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u6210\u719f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u50a8\u91cf\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6f6e\u6c50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8131\u6c14\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e74\u9f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u50a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u6b21\u751f\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u8d85\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u5ca9\u6d46\u6d77\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions.

We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass.

The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating simultaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement traditional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity > 6 GV.

Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u65b0\u7684Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56)\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86JWST\u7684NIRCam\u6210\u50cf\u548cNIRSpec\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5019\u9009\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u591a\u91cd\u6210\u50cf\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u516d\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5149\u8c31\u7ea2\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ea2\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5019\u9009\u56fe\u50cf\u6539\u8fdb\u900f\u955c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Lenstool\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6655\u3001\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6210\u5458\u3001\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u5185\u6c14\u4f53\u4ee5\u53ca\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6838\u5fc3\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7fa4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6655\u3002\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53cc\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u4e9a\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5927\u5149\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6655\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e09\u500d\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ea2\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u900f\u955c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5728BCGs\u9644\u8fd160kpc\u5904\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8be6\u7ec6\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u900f\u955c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u4e0a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7ec4\u88c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We map the extraplanar gas, with $\\sim$50-200 pc resolution, in nine star-forming galaxies using Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations from the GECKOS VLT Large Program targeting edge-on galaxies with similar stellar mass as the Milky Way. The narrow range in stellar mass ($\\pm0.35$ dex) of the GECKOS sample makes it ideal for studying trends with star formation rate (SFR). We find strong extraplanar emission reaching $\\sim$2-8 kpc from the disk midplane in all targets with $\\rm{SFR}\\geq$1 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Targets with SFR$\\,\\geq\\,$5 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ have brighter, more extended H$\u03b1$ emission compared to lower SFR targets. In high-SFR systems, the gas velocity dispersion ($\u03c3_{\\rm H\u03b1}$) shows a biconical morphology, consistent with the expectation of outflows. This agrees with previous works suggesting high velocity dispersion in a biconical shape is a good means to identify outflows. We find mixed results using line diagnostics ([OIII]$_{5007}$/H$\u03b2$ - [NII]/H$\u03b1$ and $\u03c3_{\\rm H\u03b1}$ - [SII]/H$\u03b1$) to spatially resolve ionisation mechanisms across the extraplanar gas. The highest [NII]/H$\u03b1$ are the extraplanar gas of the highest SFR systems, yet main-sequence galaxies have the highest [OIII]/H$\u03b2$. While the morphology of [NII]/H$\u03b1$ may be useful to identify outflows, the absolute value of the line ratio alone may not distinguish strong outflows from extraplanar gas of main-sequence galaxies. The ubiquitous extraplanar emission can be interpreted as the result of feedback, in the form of large-scale winds for starbursts or smaller-scale galactic fountains for main-sequence galaxies. Moreover, shock-heating may ionise gas at the interface of the disk and the circumgalactic medium, independent of the source of the gas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528MUSE\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5916\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff08SFR\uff09\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4eae\u3001\u66f4\u5ef6\u5c55\u7684H\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u53cc\u9525\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5916\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff08SFR\uff09\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5e73\u9762\u5916\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u8fa8\u7535\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MUSE\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5916\u6c14\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0850-200 pc\uff09\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76H\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8SFR\uff08\u22655 M\u2299 yr\u22121\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5916H\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u66f4\u4eae\u3001\u66f4\u5ef6\u5c55\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5448\u53cc\u9525\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5916\u6d41\uff1b\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8SFR\u661f\u7cfb[NII]/H\u03b1\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u7cfb\u7684[OIII]/H\u03b2\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u9762\u5916\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u5916\u6d41\u6216\u661f\u7cfb\u55b7\u6cc9\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6fc0\u6ce2\u52a0\u70ed\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u5468\u4ecb\u8d28\u4ea4\u754c\u5904\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u3002"}}

Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\\rm vib} \\approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers.

As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $\u039b$LTB model and use it as a set of \"glasses\" through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $\u039b$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies. More broadly, we highlight that cosmology currently lacks a widely accepted baseline model that is both theoretically well founded and capable of accommodating the Hubble and dark-energy tensions, leaving us without a true concordance framework for forecasting future surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6807\u51c6$\u039b$CDM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f53\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u81a8\u80c0\u5bf9\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u5747\u5300$\u039b$LTB\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u3001\u5076\u6781\u5f20\u529b\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6$\u039b$CDM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u5747\u5300$\u039b$LTB\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u3001\u5076\u6781\u6027\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u3001CMB\u548c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "$\u039b$LTB\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u8c61\u5c40\u90e8\u8c03\u6574$H_{0}$\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u5076\u6781\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u6001\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u80fd\u5426\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\u575a\u5b9e\u53c8\u80fd\u5bb9\u7eb3\u591a\u91cd\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f62\u6210\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions.

We combined stereoscopic hard X-ray (HXR) observations from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) and the Solar Orbiter/Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) with a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation constrained by observed photospheric magnetic fields. During the two main peaks of the impulsive phase, HXR footpoints appeared at different locations, indicating a migration of the primary reconnection site in the corona. Our data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduced the reconnected field lines linking the observed conjugate HXR footpoints. Furthermore, the simulation shows that these primary reconnections occur along a single quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) system. Therefore, the two main peaks of HXR can be interpreted as episodic energy release within the single QSL system. This study demonstrates that the data-constrained MHD model provides a realistic 3D magnetic context for interpreting HXR emission. Notably, STIX observations revealed a vertically distributed thermal HXR source, extending from the footpoints to the looptop, with its centroid migrating between the two peaks.

Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \\le 61$ and $K_a \\le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group.

Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R < 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\u03c3$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (< 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (> 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0f\u578bHII\u533a\u57df\uff08\u534a\u5f84R < 20 pc\uff09\u7684\u5927\u5c0f-\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u5de8\u578bHII\u533a\u57df\u9075\u5faa\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u8f7b\u548c\u5e74\u8001HII\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6e4d\u6d41\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578bHII\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5927\u5c0f-\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u793a\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LAMOST MRS-N\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8610\u4e2a\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u5c0f\u578bHII\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u578bHII\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u5de8\u578b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e0e\u5e74\u8001\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6e4d\u6d41\u673a\u5236\u5728HII\u533a\u57df\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u5e74\u8f7b\u533a\u57df\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u503e\u659c\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7531\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u62d6\u62fd\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u626d\u66f2\u5bf9\u76d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5feb\u901f\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u62b5\u6d88\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5185\u6d41\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u626d\u66f2\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u526a\u5207\u9ecf\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u5929\u4f53\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u652f\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4ea4\u53c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u652f\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4ea4\u53c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e9a\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u9ecf\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u6216\u5c04\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8584\u76d8\u6495\u88c2\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u626d\u66f2\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.\n  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.\n  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.\n  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.\n  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase.

Parameter study using potential field initial conditions", "comment": "submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics; 10 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, incl. appendix; abstract shortened compared to PDF", "summary": "Context. Existing sunspot simulations fail to reproduce the observed magnetic field distribution due to an artificially increased $B_{hor}$ at the upper boundary.\n  Aims. We explore alternative ways to better reproduce the magnetic and dynamic properties of observed sunspots.\n  Methods. We use the radiative MHD code MURaM. As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top.\n  Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae. (2) The penumbral-to-spot sizes are smaller than those measured in observed sunspots. (3) In none of the runs are pure Evershed (radially outward) flows. Instead, bi-directional flows with inflows in the inner penumbra and outflows in the outer penumbra were measured, similar to early observations of penumbra formation for runs with $\\ge80$ kG at 96/32 km resolution, whereas runs with 40 kG or less showed pure inflows. (4) Simulations with 160 kG at 32/16 km resolution contain filaments with bi-directional and Evershed flows. (5) Simulations with fluxes $>10^{22}$ Mx show unrealistically strong fields in the umbra. (6) The best runs with 160 kG and $10^{22}$ Mx give realistic radial profiles of $B_z$ and $B_r$, although stronger fields than observed.

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u90a6\u8fea\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u9ad8\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u6d41\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5438\u79ef\u6d41\uff08ADAFs\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u5438\u79ef\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u90a6\u8fea\u5438\u79ef\u4e0eADAFs\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6d41\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u8fde\u63a5\u90a6\u8fea\u5438\u79ef\u4e0eADAFs\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u9ecf\u5ea6\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u6062\u590d\u90a6\u8fea\u89e3\u548c\u65e0\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684ADAFs\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u7531\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ecf\u5ea6\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism.

The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\\varphi) = -\u039e\\varphi$, respectively, with $\u039e$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lema\u00eetre parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z< 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\\varphi)$ imply that $\\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\\varphi)$ and $V(\\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Brans-Dicke\u7c7b\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b87\u5b99\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5f31\u573a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3aRefracted Gravity\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u52a8\u80fd\u9879\u548c\u81ea\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f31\u573a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u867d\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u661f\u7cfb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4ed6\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u80fd\u9879\u548c\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "A major challenge in identifying massive quiescent galaxies at $z>3$ is distinguishing truly passive systems from dust-obscured star-forming galaxies, as both populations exhibit similar red ultraviolet (UV)-to-near-infrared (NIR) colors. In this work, we present ALMA Band 7 dust-continuum observations of five ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\\log (M_\\star / M_\\odot) > 11$) spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\\rm spec} > 3$ from the MAGAZ3NE survey. Our results reveal that only one galaxy shows a faint 870 \\um\\ dust continuum detection, while the remaining four UMGs are undetected down to the $3\u03c3$ depth . By incorporating ALMA constraints into the spectral energy distribution analysis, we confirm that these UV-NIR-selected systems are truly quiescent UMGs, lying more than one dex below the star-forming main sequence with $\\mathrm{\\log (sSFR/Gyr^{-1}) < -1}$, thereby ruling out the possibility of obscured star formation. We then estimate dust masses using both spectral energy distribution modeling and modified blackbody fitting, with consistent results between the two methods. We find that three UMGs have evolved into extremely dust-poor quiescent galaxies, with $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}/M_\\star \\lesssim 10^{-4}$, while the ALMA-detected galaxy has a comparatively higher dust reservoir with $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}/M_\\star \\sim 10^{-3}$. Our results present the most massive and extremely dust-poor spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies known at $3 < z < 4$, providing valuable observational constraints on rapid dust removal and quenching processes in the early universe.

To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $\u0393$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years.

The nuclear K-band spectra (central $\\sim$1-3 kpc of the QSO2s) reveal signatures of high-velocity outflows in either the Pa$\u03b1$ or Br$\u03b3$ lines, depending on the redshift, and in the [Si VI] lines. The broadest kinematic components have full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\sim$1200-2500 km $s^{-1}$. From the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines we derived ionized outflow masses of $M_{Hion} \\sim0.08-20\\times 10^{6}~M_{\\odot}$, mass outflow rates of $\\dot{M}_{Hion}\\sim0.03-6~M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}$, and kinetic powers of $\\dot{E}_{Hion}\\sim 10^{37.8-40.8}~erg~s^{-1}$. These ionized gas outflow masses and mass outflow rates have median values that are 5.9 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than those derived from the [Si VI] line. Our study provides evidence, at least for these six QSO2s, that the near-infrared recombination lines and [Si VI] are tracing the same outflow (i.e., they have similar kinematics and radii), but they carry different amounts of mass. We detected warm molecular lines in the six QSO2s, from which we measured total (nuclear) gas masses from 1.1 (0.7) to 32 (13) $\\times~10^3~M_{\\odot}$, similar to other QSO2s with warm $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, but we did not find any molecular outflow associated with them. Comparing with other five QSO2s with $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, we find that the four QSO2s with detected $H_2$ outflows have total (nuclear) $H_2$ masses 2.2 (2.7) times larger, on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e866\u4e2a\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u5b81\u9759\u578b2\u7c7b\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\uff08QSO2s\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u901f\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u901f\u7387\u53ca\u52a8\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u6c14\u4f53\u4e0e[S\u202fVI]\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63a2\u7d22QSO2s\u4e2d\u9ad8\u901f\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ebf\u548c[S\u202fVI]\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u901f\u7387\u53ca\u52a8\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752810.4\u7c73Gran Telescopio Canarias\u4e0a\u7684EMIR\u4eea\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u7f1d\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790Pa\u03b1\u3001Br\u03b3\u548c[Si\u202fVI]\u7ebf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u901f\u7387\u53ca\u52a8\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u901f\u5916\u6d41\u7684FWHM\u4e3a1200-2500\u202fkm/s\uff0c\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u8303\u56f40.08-20\u00d710\u2076\u202fM\u2299\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u73870.03-6\u202fM\u2299/yr\uff0c\u52a8\u80fd10\u00b3\u2077.\u2078-4\u2070.\u2078\u202ferg/s\u3002\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ebf\u4e0e[Si\u202fVI]\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5916\u6d41\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff08\u4e2d\u503c5.9\u500d\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u70ed\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u4f46\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u5916\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ebf\u548c[Si\u202fVI]\u7ebf\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u76f8\u540c\u5916\u6d41\u4f46\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5916\u6d41\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aQSO2s\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Using the IRAM 30-m telescope at lambda = 1.4 and 3 mm, we probed the molecular gas distribution at angular resolutions of ~12\"-28\" (0.1-0.3 pc at d = 2.1 kpc). The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1.

We construct 38,334 cutouts of well-resolved galaxies in the g, r, i bands, applying a novel \"tiered sigmoid scaling function\" to dynamically adjust image contrast according to the object's signal-to-noise and background level. A supplemental labeled sample of 366 galaxies enables qualitative assessment of the learned embeddings. We train a convolutional neural network with image augmentations including injection of simulated background stars, and project the resulting 512-dimensional representations into two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and its local density preserving variant (densMAP). We find that the NNCLR latent space recovers global trends corresponding to major merger features, yet does not reliably separate stellar streams without further supervision. To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy.

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($\u03b2= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates.

Utilising the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) and the pyPAHdb spectral modelling tool, we analysed the MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the \"PDRs4All\" ERS Program. pyPAHdb modelling reveals the fractional contribution of the different PAH charge states and sizes to the total PAH emission across the Orion Bar. Cationic PAH emission peaks in the APDR region, where neutral PAHs have minimal contribution. Emission from neutral PAHs peaks in the HII region that consists of emission from a face-on PDR associated to the background OMC-1 molecular cloud, and in the molecular cloud regions past DF2. PAH anions are observed deep within the DF2 and DF3 zones. The average PAH size ranges between ~$60-74$ Nc. The modelling reveals regions of top-down PAH formation at the ionisation front, and bottom-up PAH formation within the molecular cloud region. The PAH ionisation parameter $\u03b3$ ranges between ~$2-9 x 10^4$. Intensity ratios tracing PAH ionisation scale well with $\u03b3$ in regions encompassing edge-on or face-on PDR emission, but their correlation weakens within the molecular cloud zone. Modelling of the $5-15$ $\u03bc$m PAH spectrum with pyPAHdb achieves comprehensive characterization of the net contribution of neutral and cationic PAHs across different environments, whereas empirical PAH proxy intensity ratio tracers can be highly variable and unreliable outside regions dominated by PDR emission. The derived average PAH size in the different physical zones is consistent with a view of PAHs being more extensively subjected to ultraviolet processing closer to the ionisation front, and less affected within the molecular cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u730e\u6237\u661f\u68d2\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u533a\u57df\u7684PAH\uff08\u591a\u73af\u82b3\u9999\u70c3\uff09\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PAH\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3PAH\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982HII\u533a\u3001\u539f\u5b50PDR\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u533a\uff09\u7684\u7535\u8377\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528NASA Ames\u7684PAH\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08PAHdb\uff09\u548cpyPAHdb\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\"PDRs4All\"\u8ba1\u5212\u7684MIRI-MRS\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0PAH\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u5728\u539f\u5b50PDR\u533a\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e2d\u6027PAH\u5728HII\u533a\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u533a\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0cPAH\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6df1\u90e8DF\u533a\u3002PAH\u5927\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u572860-74Nc\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u7535\u79bb\u53c2\u6570\u03b3\u4ecb\u4e8e2-9x10^4\u3002", "conclusion": "PAH\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0cpyPAHdb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30PAH\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6bd4\u7387\u5728\u975ePDR\u533a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

NGC 4278, a local LLAGN, has recently been identified as a VHE source following detections by LHAASO. In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($\u03b4\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{\u03bd_\u03bc} \\sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons).

We compare these to the CDM suite of Storm simulations including both DMO and dark matter + hydrodynamics runs, in order to test core-formation (and core-collapse) across different dark matter models. We show that Ms.Marvel DMO can reproduce core slopes consistent with observations of isolated dwarf galaxies and more massive ($\\text{M}_{vir} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) CDM dwarf halos that include stellar feedback from the matched CDM run (Storm CDM+baryons). We identify nine Ms.Marvel SIDM DMO halos in the core-collapse phase of gravothermal evolution with halo masses below $2\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$. We find that using core slope to measure the core-collapse timescales of Ms.Marvel DMO halos agrees well with predicted collapse times estimated with the parametric model for SIDM halos introduced by \\cite{Yang2023}. Additionally, compared to central density, core slope is less sensitive to both the radius of measurement and halo merger history. These results indicate that the slope of the inner DM density profile more cleanly differentiates core-collapsed versus core-forming halos than central density amplitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
