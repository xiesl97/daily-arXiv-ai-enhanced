As these photons travel through the intergalactic medium, their scattering cross-section is often approximated as a delta function at resonance due to computational cost. That is, photons with emitted wavelengths between Ly$\u03b1$ and Ly$\u03b2$ are assumed to travel in straight lines until they redshift into the Ly$\u03b1$ resonance. However, due to the damping wing in the Ly$\u03b1$ cross-section, this approximation fails as the frequency of the photon approaches the resonant frequency, resulting in multiple scatterings events that could be separated by non-negligible distances. Some previous works studied this effect of Ly$\u03b1$ multiple scattering by running computationally heavy radiative-transfer simulations. However, robustly interpreting the cosmic 21cm signal requires exploring a large parameter space of astrophysical uncertainties, motivating more computationally-efficient approaches. Here we incorporate Ly$\u03b1$ multiple scatterings in the public, semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the trajectories of Ly$\u03b1$ photons on different scales. We find that the distance distributions of Ly$\u03b1$ photons with respect to the absorption point can be modeled as analytical functions that are governed by a single parameter. Upon implementing the distance distributions in 21cmFAST, we find that the multiple scattering effect is important (about 50% difference in the 21-cm power spectrum) only at high redshifts before the spin temperature is fully coupled to the kinetic temperature. Furthermore, we find that Ly$\u03b1$ multiple scattering does not enhance Ly$\u03b1$ heating, and that the combined effect is negligible, especially under realistic X-ray heating scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ly\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u9ece\u660e\u65f6\u671f\u5bf921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e8621cmFAST\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5bf921\u5398\u7c73\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u65f6\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9Ly\u03b1\u52a0\u70ed\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u5fae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86Ly\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u9760\u8fd1\u5171\u632f\u9891\u7387\u65f6\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8621\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ly\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7531\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u534a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df21cmFAST\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u5bf921\u5398\u7c73\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6e29\u5ea6\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u8026\u5408\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u65f6\u671f\u663e\u8457\uff08\u5dee\u5f02\u7ea650%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9Ly\u03b1\u52a0\u70ed\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "Ly\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u65f6\u5bf921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645X\u5c04\u7ebf\u52a0\u70ed\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9Ly\u03b1\u52a0\u70ed\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\u3002"}}

Fueled by advances in theory, simulations, and observations, void science has matured into a precision tool for constraining the parameters of the standard cosmological model and its possible extensions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the statistical tools developed to characterize voids, the theoretical models that link them to cosmological parameters, and the methodologies used to extract information from survey data. We highlight the growing synergy between void-based observables and other cosmological probes, and showcase the increasingly stringent constraints derived from voids measured from current survey data and expected from future missions.

Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure.

Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\\% but not more than 70\\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u671f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u665a\u671f\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u662f\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u9014\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u5c31\u5730\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u76d8\u8fc1\u79fb\u6216\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5468\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u6bd4\u8f83\u94f6\u6cb3\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u8fd1\u592a\u9633\u533a\u7684\u5e74\u9f84-\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u6821\u51c6\u7edd\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5e74\u9f84\u5927\u4e8e\u5cf0\u503c\u5916\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81f3\u5c1140%\u4f46\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc770%\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671f\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u8fc1\u79fb\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u665a\u671f\u7684\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u6210\u540e1.5 Gyr\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u3002"}}

In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV.

In close massive binaries, previous theoretical studies suggest that tides systematically boost chemical mixing. However, observations do not reveal any clear period-nitrogen enrichment trend, challenging these predictions. In addition, comprehensive examinations of the interplay between tidal interactions, angular momentum and chemicals transport have so far been scarce. We investigate the interplay between tidal interactions and rotational mixing, and the impact of the angular moment transport (AMT) assumptions. We examine whether tidal interactions enhance or suppress chemical mixing by computing grids of genec binary models with various AMT treatments. In order to independently assess the role of tidal interactions, we systematically compute model variations of single stars with identical initial conditions. Our investigations reveal that tides can either enhance or suppress mixing relative to single-star models, and that the outcome is highly sensitive to the AMT assumptions. We identify a key contrast between the two types of computed models: in close systems subject to tides, magnetic models predict that the mixing efficiency is mostly determined by the orbital configuration, whereas in hydrodynamic models it also depends on the assumed initial velocity. As a result, hydro models may display non-monotonic period-enrichment trends, or even period-enrichment correlations. These results highlight the importance of the AMT assumptions in modeling binaries with tidal interactions. The sensitivity of the predictions of hydro models to initial conditions extends the size of the period-enrichment parameter space they cover, allowing them to accommodate for peculiar observed systems, i.e., with mild enrichment at short periods, or high enrichment at longer periods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bc6\u8fd1\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u661f\u4e2d\u6f6e\u6c50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6f6e\u6c50\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u6291\u5236\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6f6e\u6c50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53cc\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u6f6e\u6c50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u4f20\u8f93\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6c2e\u5bcc\u96c6\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u5904\u7406\u7684GENEC\u53cc\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f6e\u6c50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6f6e\u6c50\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u78c1\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8f68\u9053\u6784\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bcc\u96c6\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u6f6e\u6c50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53cc\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In the residual X-ray surface brightness maps, where the global ICM distribution has been subtracted, cold fronts generated by gas sloshing are observed at the boundaries of the spiral excesses. We perform a systematic and comprehensive study of the surface brightness edges along the spiral excesses. We find the deficit of the thermal pressure radially inward of the brightness edges, in contrast to stripping cold fronts that typically exhibit higher thermal pressure in brightness edges. Assuming that the sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness distributions are sustained entirely by the gas bulk motions, we estimate the velocity gradients across the edges that are required to compensate for the deficit of the thermal pressure.

We introduce a method that relies exclusively on tracking individual maser components, rather than assuming a single averaged trajectory as in previous works, thereby avoiding arbitrary data averaging that can bias interpretations of the disk's geometry and dynamics. This approach requires spatially resolved individual maser components; consequently, the majority of observational epochs were excluded, as they lack sufficient spatial resolution to localize the maser position. We track individual maser components across multiple epochs and introduce an efficient marginalization method over nuisance parameters (angular radius and azimuth of each maser), reducing the number of free parameters from hundreds to 14. Our analysis reveals that the current observational cadence is insufficient to reliably track the individual masers, which our method relies on, given their intrinsic variability. Across a range of maser selections and model configurations, inferred distances span approximately between 6.7 to 8.1 Mpc, demonstrating significant sensitivity to how our method selects individual masers. Even visually and statistically robust fits can differ by several standard deviations, reflecting ambiguity in component identification across sparsely sampled epochs. We evaluate the impact of observational cadence on tracking fidelity and distance precision, and show that high-cadence monitoring is needed for our method to track individual masers and produce a robust anchor for cosmology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u4e86NGC 4258\u4e2d\u7684\u6c34\u8109\u6cfd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5355\u4e2a\u8109\u6cfd\u7ec4\u5206\u800c\u975e\u5e73\u5747\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u56f4\u8f83\u5e7f\uff086.7\u81f38.1 Mpc\uff09\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30NGC 4258\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08\u76ee\u524d\u7ea6\u4e3a7.6 Mpc\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a\u767e\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u662f\u6cb3\u5916\u8ddd\u79bb\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u5747\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5355\u4e2a\u8109\u6cfd\u7ec4\u5206\u800c\u975e\u5e73\u5747\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4ece\u6570\u767e\u964d\u81f314\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u5197\u4f59\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8109\u6cfd\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u56f4\u8f83\u5e7f\uff086.7\u81f38.1 Mpc\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u8109\u6cfd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5355\u4e2a\u8109\u6cfd\u548c\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u89c2\u6d4b\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

Data were stacked parallel to the eROSITA bubble edges traced by an edge detector, in the same method used previously to pick up weak signals in the smaller, nested Fermi bubbles; the detected brightness jumps were then used to measure the spectrum. We detect ($>5\u03c3$) both bubble tips in both radio and $\u03b3$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense.

While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\u00e9al in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "FRB 2025\u4f1a\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u4f4e\u6ce8\u518c\u8d39\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4(FRB)\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u4f1a\u8bae\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u4f1a\u8bae\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u804c\u4e1a\u7814\u7a76\u8005(ECRs)\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u5730\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002FRB 2025\u4f1a\u8bae\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f1a\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u7ebf\u4e0a\u76f4\u64ad\uff09\u3001\u4f4e\u6ce8\u518c\u8d39\u3001ECR\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec4\u59d4\u4f1a\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u65e5\u3001\u7d20\u98df\u9910\u996e\u548c\u95ea\u7535\u6f14\u8bb2\u66ff\u4ee3\u6d77\u62a5\u5c55\u793a\u7b49\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u4f1a\u540e\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ebf\u4e0a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff08\u5360\u534a\u6570\uff09\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u548c\u5f55\u64ad\u53cd\u9988\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u65e5\u4e5f\u5e7f\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u542c\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8bae\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "FRB 2025\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\uff082\u4e07\u52a0\u5143\uff09\u5185\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Accepted in ApJ", "summary": "Galaxy clusters serve as a unique and valuable laboratory for probing cosmological models and understanding astrophysics at the high-mass limit of structure formation. Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z > 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems.

When pairs of mirror images of such star clusters appear across the lensing critical curve, it is usually assumed that both images will display identical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, this assumption may be invalidated in the presence of gravitational microlensing from stars or other compact objects in the lens, since microlensing will affect the SED contribution from bright stars within the star cluster independently in the two mirror images. Here, we explore under what circumstances mismatched mirror-image SEDs are likely to be observable, and argue that SED differences detectable in JWST observations of lensing-cluster fields will be limited to star clusters of mass $< 10^5\\ M_\\odot$ and ages $\\lesssim 5$ Myr. The probability of severely mismatched mirror-image SEDs increases if the stellar initial mass function is very top-heavy and extends to stellar masses $\\gg 100\\ M_\\odot$, as has been suggested to be the case for Population III stars. The prevalence of lensed star clusters with highly discrepant mirror-image SEDs could therefore serve as a probe of very massive stars and extreme stellar populations in the early Universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u661f\u56e2\u955c\u50cf\u5149\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff08SED\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u89c2\u5bdf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5728\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e8e10^5\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u5e74\u9f84\u5c0f\u4e8e5\u767e\u4e07\u5e74\u65f6\u6700\u6613\u88abJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u661f\u65cf\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u5fae\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u955c\u50cf\u661f\u56e2SED\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u661f\u65cf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u4ee5\u53ca\u6052\u661f\u521d\u59cb\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08IMF\uff09\u5bf9\u955c\u50cfSED\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408JWST\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u661f\u56e2\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SED\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u661f\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf<10^5\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e74\u9f84<5\u767e\u4e07\u5e74\u65f6\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u82e5IMF\u66f4\u504f\u5411\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u65cf\u6052\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6982\u7387\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u900f\u955c\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u955c\u50cfSED\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u6781\u7aef\u6052\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e09\u65cf\u6052\u661f\u7b49\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Previous studies often used manual tuning or optimization methods to fit ablation and fragmentation models to optical meteor data, but subjective choices made physical properties and uncertainties difficult to compare. We develop a global, statistically robust method that uses Dynamic Nested Sampling to fit an erosion-fragmentation model to meteor light curves and deceleration measured by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system and Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras. Applied to 15 shower meteors, the method returns posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences for single- and double-fragmentation scenarios. Tests on four synthetic cases recover the known inputs, with best-guess solutions matching the true parameters. For 9 Orionids and 6 Alpha Capricornids with masses 1e-6 to 1e-5 kg, the median bulk density is 159 (+558/-57) kg/m3 for Orionids and 333 (+1089/-114) kg/m3 for Alpha Capricornids. Orionids are consistent with low-density cometary material, while Alpha Capricornids are systematically denser and show a second density cluster near 1300 kg/m3, consistent with higher-density asteroidal material.

An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<\u0393<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Galaxy clustering is a sensitive probe of the expansion history and growth of structure of the universe, and key degeneracies can be broken by combining these data with measurements of cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing (a so-called 3$\\times$2pt analysis). The largest and least biased statistical samples of galaxies for use in clustering analyses can be collected photometrically through large imaging surveys. However, selecting clean photometric subsamples for cosmology are crucial for avoiding contamination that can bias cosmological constraints. Here we present the MagLim++ galaxy sample, selected to optimize for cosmological constraining power and incorporating an array of novel quality cuts to identify and remove residual contamination. This sample comes from the full six years of observations from the Dark Energy Survey. We present measurements of the two-point angular clustering ($w(\u03b8)$) of 9,186,205 galaxies distributed over 4031 sq. degrees and in six tomographic redshift bins centered at $\\bar{z}\\approx$ [0.31, 0.44, 0.62, 0.78, 0.90, 1.01]. These measurements are used as part of the 3$\\times$2pt and other DES Y6 legacy cosmological analyses in companion works. We describe the battery of null tests and mitigation schemes implemented to address observational, astrophysical, and methodological systematics in the analysis. The resulting $w(\u03b8)$ measurements have a S/N = 149 (90.2 for linear scales only), which we use to place galaxy-clustering-only constraints on the matter density of the Universe, $\u03a9_m=0.311^{+0.023}_{-0.035}$, and amplitude of galaxy clustering in each redshift bin, $b_i\u03c3_8=[1.16^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\\ 1.40^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\\ 1.57^{+0.04}_{-0.06},\\ 1.59^{+0.04}_{-0.05},\\ 1.50^{+0.04}_{-0.05},\\ 1.74^{+0.06}_{-0.08}]$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMagLim++\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5de1\u5929\uff08DES\uff09\u516d\u5e74\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u516d\u5c42\u7ea2\u79fb\u7bb1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5173\u952e\u7b80\u5e76\u3002\u5149\u7535\u5de1\u5929\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DES\u516d\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7684MagLim++\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53bb\u9664\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6d4b\u91cf\u516d\u5c42\u7ea2\u79fb\u7bb1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b(w(\u03b8))\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u96f6\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b\uff08S/N=149\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u03a9_m\u548c\u6bcf\u5c42\u7ea2\u79fb\u7bb1\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u632f\u5e45b_i\u03c3_8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "MagLim++\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aDES Y6\u76843\u00d72pt\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Extended warm and cold gas nebulae, with complex morphologies and kinematics, have been observed in the centres of cool-core galaxy clusters. Their origin within the hot intracluster medium (ICM) is still puzzling, and among many mechanisms, positive feedback from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed. In this work, we performed a suite of very high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cool-core galaxy cluster subject to self-regulated AGN jet feedback, which leads to realistic ICM properties. By explicitly following warm ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases, we studied the complex interplay between AGN activity and the multi-phase ICM. While AGN feedback globally heats the ICM, we find that during the individual AGN jet bursts, hot material is also injected laterally to the jet axis, within the turbulent mixing layer. This material, as it expands, compresses the surrounding hot ICM, reducing the local cooling time, and leads to the formation of cold clumps on a characteristic timescale of $\\sim 30$ Myr. By employing tracers, we explicitly track cooling within the affected regions, finding that very hot gas identified in high-compression, low-vorticity zones condenses in situ to form cold clumps. A statistical analysis reveals that the condensation of cold gas is highly promoted once the local turbulent Mach number, $\u03c3_{hot}/c_{s,hot}$, in the hot gas component ($T \\geq 10^7$ K) takes values around ~0.3.

However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $\u03b7$ can reach up to 50\\% of the maximum possible efficiency $\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $\u03b7\\approx f_{\\rm sp}\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\\rm sp} \\lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u4e2d\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u51b7\u5374\u6d41\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u6c14\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\uff09\uff0c\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc73D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Perseus\u7c7b\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u4f46\u78c1\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4f20\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u70ed\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u70ed\u6cf5\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6574\u4f53\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002"}}

This paper quantifies and explores an important caveat: apparent nonlinear motion due to a star's nonzero radial velocity can be indistinguishable from real astrometric acceleration. This nonlinear motion is parallel to the proper motion, so it can be both quantified and avoided by projecting apparent astrometric accelerations into components parallel and perpendicular to the proper motion. We illustrate this distinction for a sample of very nearby, fast-moving stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). We then generalize the effect of stellar radial velocity and projections of the astrometric acceleration to binary stars in which we observe the acceleration of both components. Finally, we demonstrate that the proper motion differences in the HGCA are statistically well-behaved even for the nearest and fastest-moving stars, at least in the component perpendicular to the proper motion.

Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661fWD 1856+534\u9644\u8fd1\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5bf9\u5176\u5438\u79ef\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u5149\u7403\u5c42\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5438\u79ef\u4e86\u6b8b\u4f59\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46WD 1856+534\u5374\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u5982\u4f55\u963b\u6b62\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u8f93\u9001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u671f\u7684N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u884c\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u629b\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3cWD1856+534b\u7684\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff08\u8d28\u91cf\u22650.5\u500d\u6728\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb0.02 au\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e05\u9664\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u3002\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u7387\u968f\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u51cf\u5c0f\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u5149\u7403\u5c42\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1.

Oscillation spectra of helium-core-burning stars sometimes show extra peaks that remain unexplained by the dipole mixed-mode pattern expected from the coupling of a radiative cavity in the stellar core and a pressure cavity in the stellar envelope. We use the asymptotic expansion developed for a multi-cavity star in order to characterize these extra peaks. The analytical resonance condition of the multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes, with two inner gravity cavities and an outer pressure cavity, helps us explain that the apparent extra peaks are dipole mixed modes that follow the 3-cavity oscillation pattern. The derivation of the two asymptotic period spacings associated with the two distinct regions in the radiative core provides an estimate of the full radiative cavity. Our results provide new constraints for analysing the overshoot or mixing in the core of helium-core-burning stars.

We perform a large-scale structure analysis using three two-point correlation functions (3$\\times$2pt): (i) cosmic shear from 140 million source galaxy shapes, (ii) galaxy clustering of 9 million lens galaxy positions, and (iii) galaxy-galaxy lensing from their cross-correlation. We model the data in flat $\u039b$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\\equiv \u03c3_8 (\u03a9_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\u03a9_{\\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\u039b$CDM (68\\% CL), where $\u03c3_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\u03c3$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\u03c3$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\u03a9_{\\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$. For the first time, we combine all DES dark-energy probes: 3$\\times$2pt, SNe Ia, BAO and Clusters. In $\u039b$CDM this combination yields a $2.8\u03c3$ parameter difference from the CMB. When combining DES 3$\\times$2pt with other low-redshift datasets (DESI DR2 BAO, DES SNe Ia, SPT clusters), we find a 2.3$\u03c3$ parameter difference with CMB. A joint fit of Y6 3$\\times$2pt, CMB, and those low-redshift datasets produces the tightest $\u039b$CDM constraints to date: $S_8 = 0.806^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$, $\u03a9_{\\rm m} = 0.302^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, $h = 0.683^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$, and $\\sum m_\u03bd< 0.14$ eV (95\\% CL).

However, our galaxy also contains a non-axisymmetric stellar bar, which traps stars in resonant orbits, leading to substructures in phase-space. Using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we explore the connection between the bar and the accreted stellar halo. We find that the bar induces prominent substructures, or \"ridges\", in E-Lz, caused by the resonances. The most pronounced of these is caused by the corotation and the retrograde 1:1 resonances, with weaker ridges visible due to the prograde 1:1 and outer Lindblad resonance. The ridges are present across much of the stellar halo, with variations in radius due to the morphology of different orbital families. We explore the scattering of orbits at the resonances, finding that stars trapped at the 1:1 retrograde resonance become more circularised and have more negative angular momentum. Additionally, stars can move between the corotation and retrograde 1:1 families, thus alternating between prograde and retrograde motion. Due to these scatterings and the pre-existing metallicity gradients in the accreted population, the bar-induced substructures have distinct metallicities compared to stars in the surrounding phase-space. Our results suggest the need for caution when searching the Milky Way stellar halo for accreted substructures in both integral of motions and chemical spaces, since these can be induced by internal perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u4f1a\u5728\u80fd\u91cf-\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff08E-Lz\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u201c\u810a\u7ebf\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6e90\u4e8e\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5438\u79ef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\u5728E-Lz\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u5916\u90e8\u5438\u79ef\u9057\u5b58\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff08Milky Way\u7c7b\u4f3c\u661f\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u6052\u661f\u6655\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5728E-Lz\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u5728E-Lz\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5171\u632f\u810a\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5171\u8f6c\u548c\u9006\u884c1:1\u5171\u632f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u8f68\u9053\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f62\u6001\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u56e0\u8f68\u9053\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u539f\u6709\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u800c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u9192\uff0c\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6052\u661f\u6655\u4e2d\u641c\u5bfb\u5438\u79ef\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u533a\u5206\u5185\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u6052\u661f\u68d2\uff09\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5224\u3002"}}

Mean motion resonances beyond 50 AU", "comment": "28 pages, 13 figures, 5 Tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study to date on Neptune's mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in the distant Kuiper belt from 50 to 100 AU. Over 200 resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have been identified in this region, spanning resonances from the 2nd-order 1:3 MMR to the 22nd-order 7:29 MMR, with inclinations $i<40^\\circ$. Building on these diverse distributions, we first analyse the dynamical features of numerous $m$:$n$ MMRs, providing an informative database that includes the possible eccentricity ($e$) range, resonance widths, resonance centres, and permissible $(e,i)$ distributions. We then conduct numerical simulations to explore the long-term stability of these MMRs. Our results show that: (1) resonators can occupy all 1:$n$ to 7:$n$ MMRs, with nearly any $n$ corresponding to the 50-100 AU region, including the farthest-out MMRs of 5:29 (24th-order), 6:35 (29th-order), and 7:40 (33rd-order). This suggests that KBOs could potentially exist in even higher-order MMRs than those currently observed. (2) For each set of $m$:$n$ resonances with the same $m$, resonators consistently exhibit inclinations up to $40^\\circ$, while eccentricities remain strictly restricted below 0.7. (3) For the 1:3 and 1:4 MMRs, the leading population is less stable than the trailing population. Most interestingly, we discover a novel phenomenon of number reversal, where the higher-order, weaker 3:8 MMR (at semimajor axis $a\\approx57.9$ AU) hosts more resonators, rather than fewer as expected, compared to the lower-order, stronger 3:7 MMR (at $a\\approx53.0$ AU). Future observations, whether confirming or challenging this phenomenon, will offer valuable insight into the eccentricity and inclination distributions of primordial KBOs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d77\u738b\u661f50-100AU\u8303\u56f4\u5185Kuiper\u5e26\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u52a8\u5171\u632f\uff08MMRs\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86200\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u632fKBOs\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5171\u632f\u5668\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e38\u7684\u9ad8\u9636MMR\u6bd4\u4f4e\u9636MMR\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u5171\u632f\u5668\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u5bf9Kuiper\u5e26\u4e2d\u6d77\u738b\u661fMMRs\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u9636MMRs\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u59cbKBOs\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cdm:n MMRs\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u503e\u89d2\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5171\u632f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7b49\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9bMMRs\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKBOs\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6240\u67091:n\u52307:n MMRs\u4e2d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684MMRs\uff1b\u5171\u632f\u5668\u7684\u503e\u89d2\u53ef\u8fbe40\u00b0\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u57280.7\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff1b1:3\u548c1:4 MMRs\u7684\u9886\u5148\u7fa4\u4e0d\u5982\u5c3e\u968f\u7fa4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e38\u76843:8 MMR\u6bd43:7 MMR\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u5171\u632f\u5668\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u53cd\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u539f\u59cbKBOs\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u503e\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\u03b3$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\u03b3-\u03b3$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\u03b1$. In particular, spectra with $\u03b1> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame).

In order to investigate how well radio luminosity traces star formation rate (SFR) in the early Universe, we have examined the radio properties of a JWST Paschen-alpha sample of galaxies at 1.0<=z<=1.8. In the GOODS-S field, we cross-matched a sample of 506 FRESCO Paschen-alpha emitters with the 1.23 GHz radio continuum data from the MeerKAT MIGHTEE survey finding 47 detections. After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at ~3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z<0.2) to high redshift (z~1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0<=z<=1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations.

Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter \u03bb of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from \u03bb = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter \u03bb of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u4ece0\u52300.1\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7279\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6655\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u7684\u5c48\u66f2\u5bf9\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u68d2\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\u53d7\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6655\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5185\u6655\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $\u03c3(\u03bb)\\times \\dot M \\le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9003\u9038\u5927\u6c14\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u7ebf\u9971\u548c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u53cd\u6f14\u5931\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5927\u6c14\uff0c\u800c\u9003\u9038\u5927\u6c14\u7684\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u900f\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7a33\u6001\u3001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u7b49\u6e29\u6d41\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff1a\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u533a\uff0c\u900f\u5c04\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u540e\uff0c\u8c31\u7ebf\u6838\u5fc3\u9971\u548c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u552f\u4e00\u7ea6\u675f\u8d28\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u3002\u9971\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7531\u516c\u5f0f$\u03c3(\u03bb)\u00d7M\u0307\u2264C_{sat}$\u754c\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u7ebf\u9971\u548c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5438\u6536\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u5173\u7cfb\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5f31\u7ebf\u53ca\u7ebf\u7ffc\u4ecd\u5177\u8bca\u65ad\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

As the interiors of these objects remain hidden from direct observation, numerical models of convection are an important tool in the study of astrophysical dynamos. In such models, unrealistic large values of the viscous ($\u03bd$) and thermal ($\u03ba$) diffusivity are routinely used as an ad-hoc representation of the effects of subgrid scale turbulence which is otherwise too small-scale to resolve numerically. However, the functional forms of these diffusion coefficients can vary greatly between studies, complicating efforts to compare between results and against observations. We explore this issue by considering a series of non-rotating, non-magnetic, solar-like convection models with varying radial functions for the diffusivities and differing boundary conditions. We find that the bulk kinetic energy scales similarly regardless of the diffusivity parameterization. This scaling is consistent with a free-fall scaling, wherein viscosity plays a subdominant role in the force balance. We do not, however, observe such diffusion-free behavior in the convective heat transport. Our results also indicate that the functional form adopted for the diffusion coefficients can impact the distribution of turbulence within the convective shell. These results suggest that some care should be taken when comparing solar convection models directly against helioseismic observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5bf9\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u7c7b\u592a\u9633\u5bf9\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u80fd\u6807\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u70ed\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u6269\u6563\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6d41\u5728\u6052\u661f\u548c\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u78c1\u573a\u751f\u6210\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u7c7b\u592a\u9633\u5bf9\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f84\u5411\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u80fd\u6807\u5ea6\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u6807\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u7c98\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u6b21\u8981\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u70ed\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e0d\u53d7\u6269\u6563\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8fd8\u5f71\u54cd\u6e4d\u6d41\u5728\u5bf9\u6d41\u58f3\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u592a\u9633\u5bf9\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65e5\u9707\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6e4d\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u70ed\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in RAA", "summary": "Double source plane strong lensing (DSPL) systems offer a robust, independent probe of cosmological parameters. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is expected to discover hundreds of DSPLs, yet the survey modes and system configurations that best enable cosmological inference remain uncertain. To investigate the impact of varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and Einstein radius ratios of DSPLs (denoted as $\u03b2^{-1}$ parameters) on cosmographic inference under different CSST survey modes (Wide Field (WF), Deep Field (DF), and Ultra-Deep Field (UDF)), we simulate and model mock lenses with Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profiles and S\u00e9rsic sources whose image properties are tailored to CSST specifications. Assuming a flat $w$CDM universe with fiducial values $\u03a9_{\\rm m} = 0.30966$ and $w = -1$, and uniform priors of $\u03a9_{\\rm m} \\in [0, 1]$ and $w \\in [-2, -1/3$), we find that the constraining power on cosmological parameters for a given DSPL system increases significantly with survey depth. For a representative DSPL system with two prominent arcs and a moderate $\u03b2^{-1}=1.17$, the constraints on ($w, \u03a9_{\\rm m}$) improve from ($-1.28_{-1.00}^{+0.64}, 0.50_{-0.32}^{+0.28}$) in the WF to ($-1.59_{-0.32}^{+0.63}, 0.42_{-0.06}^{+0.15}$) in the UDF. Furthermore, we find that systems with smaller $\u03b2$ values yield tighter cosmographic constraints. We conclude that DSPL systems identified in UDF observations, particularly those with small $\u03b2$, are the most promising candidates for early-stage cosmological studies with CSST.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cc\u6e90\u5e73\u9762\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\uff08DSPL\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540cCSST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5bbd\u573aWF\u3001\u6df1\u573aDF\u3001\u8d85\u6df1\u573aUDF\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u548c\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u534a\u5f84\u6bd4\uff08$\u03b2^{-1}$\uff09\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cUDF\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f$\u03b2$\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff08$w, \u03a9_{\\rm m}$\uff09\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7DSPL\u7cfb\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002CSST\u9884\u8ba1\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u767e\u4e2aDSPL\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08WF\u3001DF\u3001UDF\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\uff08SNR\u3001$\u03b2^{-1}$\uff09\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SIE\u8d28\u91cf\u5256\u9762\u548cS\u00e9rsic\u6e90\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u900f\u955c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cCSST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684DSPL\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u5e73\u5766$w$CDM\u5b87\u5b99\uff08$\u03a9_{\\rm m} = 0.30966$, $w = -1$\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u5300\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "UDF\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0cDSPL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9$w$\u548c$\u03a9_{\\rm m}$\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eWF\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5c0f$\u03b2$\u503c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "UDF\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5c0f$\u03b2$ DSPL\u7cfb\u7edf\u662fCSST\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5019\u9009\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Using both Gemini/GMOS slitmask spectra and deep VLT/MUSE observations, we bring the total number of lensed sources up to 13, including three which were not previously known from imaging observations but are apparent in the MUSE data as emission-line sources. Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$\u03b1$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al. (2024)). The lensed sources span a redshift range from z=0.96 to 4.09 with most of them showing 3-5 images, including four sources displaying central or radial images. In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $\u03a9_m$ as well as the cluster density profile. Additionally, we present a catalog of 57 unlensed field galaxies with confident redshifts, of which 49 are associated with the cluster.

High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $\u03b3$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\\mathcal{F}_{-5}\\,{\\rm erg\\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\\,\u03c3$) of about $2.5\\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "POLAR-2\u7684HPD\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\uff08GRB\uff09\u77ac\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u9006\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u55b7\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u77ac\u65f6\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u8fa8\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u55b7\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528POLAR-2\u4e2d\u7684HPD\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u504f\u632f\u6570\u636e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u7bb1\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e3a10^-5 erg cm^-2\u7684\u6e90\uff0cHPD\u80fd\u4ee52.5%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HPD\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u6027\u80fd\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u78c1\u573a\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u55b7\u6d41\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d41\u51fa\u6210\u5206\u3002"}}

Dynamic spectra from all beams and both linear polarisations were searched channel by channel with a fast-folding algorithm sensitive to periods between 1.1 and 300 s. A multi-layer RFI-mitigation pipeline exploits multi-beam occupancy, cross-target bad-channel statistics, XX/YY polarisation coincidence, broad frequency masks, and narrow site-specific RFI exclusion zones, followed by clustering in period-frequency space. The pipeline is validated on FAST observations of PSR B0329+54, where we recover the known 0.714 s spin period and harmonic structure in the expected beam. For the stellar sample, successive cuts reduce the raw FFA hit lists (> 10^6 hits per target) to a small number of cluster-level candidates, all of which exhibit clear radio-frequency interference signatures in phase-time and phase-frequency diagnostics. We therefore report no convincing detections of periodic transmitters in our searched parameter space. Using the radiometer equation with our adopted detection threshold (S/N = 25) and assuming a duty cycle delta = 0.1, we obtain upper limits of approximately (7-9) x 10^9 W on the isotropic-equivalent EIRP of kHz-wide periodic beacons at these stars, among the most stringent constraints to date on periodic radio emission from nearby stellar systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528FAST\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5bf9\u4e94\u9897\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7a84\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684SETI\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u5916\u661f\u667a\u6167\u751f\u547d\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528FAST\u768419\u6ce2\u675fL\u6ce2\u6bb5\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u6052\u661f\u8fdb\u884c1200\u79d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u6298\u53e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u7ba1\u9053\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9kHz\u5bbd\u5e26\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u6807\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\uff087-9)\u00d710^9 W\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002"}}

This recondensation was accompanied by mass-dependent enrichment in light isotopes (for multi-isotope alkalis such as K and Rb), but its limited extent indicates a cooling acceleration (or \"quenching\").

These relationships, expressed as probability density functions, are analytic and independent of all Keplerian orbital elements so long as orbits are randomly oriented in space. I also derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the ratio of the projected separation to the semimajor axis at fixed eccentricity. This expression can be numerically integrated over eccentricity for an arbitrary distribution of eccentricities.

We investigate its effects on the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using the fiducial lens (position tracer) sample MagLim++. Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$\u03c3$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$\u03c3$ in $\u03a9_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$\u03c3$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$\u03c3$ in $\u03a9_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases. Freeing the magnification bias in lens bin 2 leads to unphysical negative values, further justifying its exclusion from the fiducial Year 6 analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9Dark Energy Survey Year 6\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u661f\u7cfb-\u661f\u7cfb\u900f\u955c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Balrog\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u6ce8\u5165\u76ee\u5f55\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u653e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5ffd\u7565\u6b64\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u82e5\u5ffd\u7565\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MagLim++\u6837\u672c\u548cBalrog\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u6ce8\u5165\u76ee\u5f55\u91cf\u5316\u653e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u653e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a[3.16\u00b10.08, 2.76\u00b10.21, 4.09\u00b10.15, 4.42\u00b10.16, 4.90\u00b10.29, 4.83\u00b10.25]\u3002\u5ffd\u7565\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4$S_8$\u548c$\u03a9_m$\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u5fc5\u987b\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800cBalrog\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

We focus on two well-known stellar overdensities in the anticenter, the Monoceros Ring (MRi) and Anticenter Stream (ACS). We find that the MRi overdensity has kinematics consistent with a tidally induced spiral arm, a type of dynamic spiral arm created by an interaction with a satellite galaxy, most likely the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). We use the kinematics of the MRi to calculate the two most recent passage times of Sgr are 0.25 $\\pm$ 0.09 Gyrs and 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.23 Gyrs from the present day. We validate that the ACS is kinematically decoupled from the MRi because they are moving in opposite radial and vertical directions. We find that the kinematics associated with the ACS are not confined to our defined overdensity.

For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $\u03b2$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \\pm 0.08$, $4.7 \\pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \\pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy.

In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely.

Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth's ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth- ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth's ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u8000\u6591\u548cCMEs\uff09\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u751a\u4f4e\u9891\uff08VLF\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f4e\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\uff08D\u533a\uff09\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efaVLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u77ac\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u7403\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u6781\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5929\u7136\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790VLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u79bb\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u5efaVLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9VLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u591a\u6b21\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u5bf9VLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u77ac\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86VLF\u4fe1\u53f7\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we design and validate the analysis pipeline for the cosmic shear, galaxy clustering plus galaxy$-$galaxy lensing ($2 \\times 2$pt), and the joint analysis in the $3 \\times 2$pt. Our framework accounts for key theoretical uncertainties, such as baryonic feedback and galaxy bias, incorporating both linear and non-linear models. We apply scale cuts in regimes where theoretical modeling becomes unreliable. The robustness of the pipeline is validated using mock data and simulations, confirming unbiased cosmological constraints and highlighting the importance of posterior projection effects in the validation process.

Previous PCA-based studies of NGC 1068 reported that physically meaningful structures are mainly captured up to the second component. In contrast, our framework can interpret physically meaningful features up to the fourth component. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our framework with molecular column densities derived from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we suggest that the abundance of HCO+ is relatively enhanced in the molecular outflow region extending to a radius of about 400 pc from the galactic center, likely due to the effects of ultraviolet radiation and highly dense gas.

In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\\rm{bin}}=4\\,M_\\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39\" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\u03b1$ emission at 0.20\" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\\sim0.1\u0394\\upsilon_{\\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528ALMA\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4bHD 34700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548cCO\u5206\u5b50\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53cc\u661fHD 34700AaAb\u5468\u56f4\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u76d8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u548c\u5927\u8154\u3002CO\u6c14\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u843d\u7269\u8d28\u6216\u9690\u85cf\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76HD 34700\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0b\u843d\u7269\u8d28\u6216\u9690\u85cf\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528ALMA Band 6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u591a\u79cdCO\u5206\u5b50\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5206\u6790CO\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u77e9\u56fe\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u5269\u4f59\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c18\u57c3\u73af\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b0\u6708\u7ed3\u6784\u548cCO\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u5c0f\u8154\uff0c\u5176\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0eH\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u73af\u5185\u7f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002CO\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\uff0cCO\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5916\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u4e00\u81f4\u300213CO\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53cd\u6c14\u65cb\u6da1\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "HD 34700A\u73af\u53cc\u661f\u76d8\u7684\u4e0a\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0b\u843d\u7269\u8d28\u6216\u9690\u85cf\u4f34\u661f\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53caRossby\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u8154\u5185\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u6270\u52a8\u3002"}}

Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources.

Revisiting the fossil field scenario with observational constraints during the red giant branch", "comment": "submitted to A&A Letters, 4 pages (5 pages of appendix), 6 figures", "summary": "The detection of strong, large-scale magnetic fields at the surface of only the oldest population of white dwarfs might point towards a hidden internal magnetic field slowly rising to the surface. In addition, strong magnetic fields have recently been measured through asteroseismology in the radiative interiors of red giant stars, the progenitors of white dwarfs. To investigate the potential connection between these observations, we revisit the fossil field framework by using the asteroseismic detections to constrain the strength of such magnetic fields as they evolve to the white dwarf stage. We assume that the magnetic field was either created during the main sequence core convection or that it fills the radiative interior as the star evolves on the red giant branch. From these, we evolve the magnetic flux, allowing for magnetic diffusion along the evolution of a 1.5Msun modelled star. We find that measured field strengths in red giants attributed to the hydrogen-burning shell are compatible with the field amplitudes and emergence timescales of magnetized white dwarfs. On the contrary, magnetic fields generated solely from a convective-core dynamo on the main-sequence and detectable during the red giant branch would be buried too deep in the star and not match the breakout timescales and the field strengths of magnetic white dwarfs. A broadly magnetized internal radiative zone during the red giant branch is therefore key for the fossil field theory to connect magnetic fields observed along the late evolution of stars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u8868\u9762\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u78c1\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u6c22\u71c3\u70e7\u58f3\u5c42\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u78c1\u5316\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5e45\u5ea6\u53ca\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4ec5\u5728\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u8868\u9762\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u78c1\u573a\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u533a\u57df\u6709\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5316\u77f3\u78c1\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acb\u6052\u661f\u665a\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u78c1\u573a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u75281.5\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6052\u661f\u6a21\u62df\u78c1\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u78c1\u573a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8e\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u6838\u5fc3\u5bf9\u6d41\u6216\u586b\u6ee1\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u5206\u652f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u78c1\u6269\u6563\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u78c1\u573a\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u6c22\u71c3\u70e7\u58f3\u5c42\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u78c1\u5316\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5e45\u5ea6\u53ca\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u7b26\uff1b\u800c\u4ec5\u7531\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u5bf9\u6d41\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ea2\u5de8\u661f\u5206\u652f\u9636\u6bb5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8f90\u5c04\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5316\u77f3\u78c1\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Two primary mechanisms drive this process: star-formation (SF) & mergers. Our understanding of star formation, and to some degree the processes that influence the baryon cycle (environment, gas supply, feedback, etc), are either relatively well constrained or will develop significantly over the coming decades via upcoming facilities (i.e. through their imprint on galaxy properties measured with deep multi-wavelength and spectroscopic data). However, the same can not be said for mergers. It is telling that we indirectly know hierarchical assembly through mergers is one of the most crucial processes that shape our Universe, but the robust observational measurement of mergers is almost non-existent outside of the local Universe - let alone how these mergers impact galaxy properties. This is not likely to significantly change in the coming decades as existing or approved facilities/surveys are inadequate in charactering mergers in the distant Universe. Motivated by this, we discuss an ambitious study to first explore mergers, and then the co-dependent astrophysical process that govern the accumulation of stellar mass over the last ~10billion years, and highlight the essential need for a 10m+ class multi-object spectroscopic facility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u901a\u8fc7\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5e76\u5408\u79ef\u7d2f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5e76\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u96c4\u5fc3\u52c3\u52c3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u5927\u578b\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u8c31\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u5e76\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u65bd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5408\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ea6100\u4ebf\u5e74\u4e2d\u661f\u7cfb\u5e76\u5408\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5efa\u8bbe10\u7c73\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u8c31\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bbe\u65bd\u5728\u523b\u753b\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b87\u5b99\u5e76\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u578b\u5149\u8c31\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5efa\u9020\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u586b\u8865\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5e76\u5408\u53ca\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u79ef\u7d2f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We imaged $\u03b3$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\\sim$0.02.

In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings.

Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\\star=1.09M_{\\odot}$, $R_\\star=1.88R_{\\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u5408TESS\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6052\u661f\u6296\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u884c\u661f\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u5408TESS\u5149\u5ea6\u548cRV\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316RV\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eHD 5562\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "GP\u56de\u5f52\u5c06RV\u6563\u5c04\u4ece2.03 m/s\u964d\u81f30.51 m/s\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u964d\u566a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5206\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u95f4\u6b47\u6027RV\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GP\u62df\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GP\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6052\u661f\u6296\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eRV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

An analysis of CO, H2O, H2O+, and dust continuum emission", "comment": null, "summary": "The formation mechanisms of intensely starbursting galaxies at high redshift remain unknown. One possible mechanism for triggering these starbursts is mergers and interactions, but detecting these at high redshift remains a challenge. Observations of high-redshift gravitationally lensed galaxies enable studies of the interstellar medium and environment of these extreme starbursts in detail. We used high angular resolution observations of dust continuum, CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and H2O+(202-111) emission to constrain the ongoing processes in the z = 3.63 gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxy H-ATLAS J083051.0+013224 (G09v1.97). We used PyAutoLens to create a de-magnified source plane CO(6-5) emission line cube and performed kinematic modeling using 3DBarolo. Additionally, we investigated the properties of the continuum and molecular line emission in the source plane. We find that the regions of CO(6-5) and H2O(211-202) emission match closely in the source plane but that the dust continuum emission is more compact. We find that our lens modeling results do not require more than one source, contrary to what has been found in previous studies. Instead, we find that G09v1.97 resembles a rotating disk with Vmax/sigma = 2.8 +/- 0.4 with evidence for residual emission indicative of non-circular motions such as outflows, tidal tails, or an additional background galaxy. We suggest that the origin of the non-circular motions may be associated with a bi-conical outflow, a tidal tail from an interaction, or indicate the possible presence of an additional galaxy. We calculate the dynamical mass, gas mass, star-formation rate, and depletion time for G09v1.97 and find a high star-formation rate and low gas depletion time. In combination, this suggests that G09v1.97 has recently undergone an interaction, triggering intense star formation, and is in the process of settling into a disk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5f3a\u661f\u66b4\u661f\u7cfbG09v1.97\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u800c\u975e\u591a\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u6d4b\u975e\u5706\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u53cc\u9525\u6d41\u51fa\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u6216\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5f3a\u661f\u66b4\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u6216\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u3001CO(6-5)\u3001H2O(211-202)\u548cH2O+(202-111)\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PyAutoLens\u548c3DBarolo\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86G09v1.97\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u4e0e\u5c18\u57c3\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "CO(6-5)\u548cH2O(211-202)\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u5728\u6e90\u5e73\u9762\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c18\u57c3\u53d1\u5c04\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\uff1bG09v1.97\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8(Vmax/\u03c3=2.8\u00b10.4),\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5706\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u53ca\u6c14\u4f53\u8017\u5c3d\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8fd1\u671f\u53ef\u80fd\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "G09v1.97\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u89e6\u53d1\u5f3a\u661f\u66b4\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u65cb\u8f6c\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u975e\u5706\u8fd0\u52a8\u6216\u4e0e\u53cc\u9525\u6d41\u51fa\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u5c3e\u7b49\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u661f\u66b4\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u89e6\u53d1\u5047\u8bf4\u3002"}}

Agis Gonz\u00e1lez", "J. -A. Acosta Pulido", "M. Kokubo"], "title": "Polarization properties of changing-look active galactic nuclei: NGC 1365 and NGC 2992", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) represent a rare class of AGNs that undergo transitions from type 1 (characterized by the presence of broad emission lines in their spectra) to type 2 (absence of broad emission lines) or vice versa, over timescales ranging from months to years. Since normal type 1 and type 2 AGNs are known to show different polarization properties, detailed investigations of the CLAGN polarization can shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the changing-look phenomenon. We present new (spectro)polarimetric observations of two changing-look AGNs located in the core of the inclined spiral galaxies NGC 1365 and NGC 2992. Both AGNs are radio emitters, thereby enabling a comparison of their polarization to the radio jet axis, which defines the accretion disk geometry. In the case of NGC 1365, the AGN shows polarization characteristics consistent with those observed in type 1 Seyferts, in particular polarization parallel to the radio jet. This intrinsic polarization is modified by the wavelength-dependent dichroic extinction that occurs in the galaxy bar and that rotates the polarization angle at the shortest wavelengths. NGC 2992, on the other hand, is so inclined that dichroic dust extinction in the disk completely dominates the polarization of the AGN, thus overwhelming any polarization due to scattering. Consequently, the polarization properties remain essentially constant between the different AGN states, and the faint broad lines observed in the polarized flux are most likely not scattered light. Differential dilution between the continuum and the narrow-line polarizations can explain the unusually high polarization measured in the emission lines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u5149\u5b66\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08CLAGN\uff09\u7684\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4ece\u7c7b\u578b1\u5230\u7c7b\u578b2\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86NGC 1365\u548cNGC 2992\u7684\u504f\u632f\u4e0e\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u8f74\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76CLAGN\u7684\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9NGC 1365\u548cNGC 2992\u4e24\u79cdCLAGN\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u7684\uff08\u5149\u8c31\uff09\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\u8f74\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "NGC 1365\u7684\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b1\u8d5b\u5f17\u7279\u661f\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u504f\u632f\u65b9\u5411\u5e73\u884c\u4e8e\u5c04\u7535\u55b7\u6d41\uff0c\u800cNGC 2992\u7684\u504f\u632f\u53d7\u5c18\u57c3\u6d88\u5149\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "CLAGN\u7684\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dNGC 1365\u7684\u504f\u632f\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u5185\u7980\u504f\u632f\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u6d88\u5149\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800cNGC 2992\u7684\u504f\u632f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5c18\u57c3\u6d88\u5149\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z > 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u665a\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5f26\u4e0e\u58c1\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bbLCDM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5e7b\u5f71\u7a7f\u8d8a\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u7b5b\u9009\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165norns\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7c92\u5b50\u7f51\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u6d3d\u5730\u6f14\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f26\u4e0e\u58c1\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7269\u8d28\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u3001\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bbLCDM\uff08\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\u7ea64-15%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08z>0.2\uff09\u65f6\u53d8\u5316\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff1b\u5438\u5f15\u6027\u7b2c\u4e94\u529b\u53ef\u5728\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5468\u56f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u5916\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6655\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e2d\u7559\u4e0b\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002"}}

Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms.

The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona.

To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of \"SN Eos\": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-\u03b1 emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300\u00c5) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u9897\u7ea2\u79fb\u503c\u4e3a5.133\u7684\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u591a\u91cd\u6210\u50cf\u7684II\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661fSN Eos\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\uff08\u7ea2\u79fbz>3\uff09\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u6052\u661f\u968f\u5b87\u5b99\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u6781\u7aef\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ea2\u79fb\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6052\u661f\u548c\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u8f83\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u53d1\u73b0\u653e\u5927\u7684\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528JWST\u548cHST\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "SN Eos\u662f\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u4ec5\u7ea610\u4ebf\u5e74\u65f6\u7206\u53d1\u7684II\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u6052\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\uff08<=0.1 Z_{\\odot}\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "SN Eos\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u671b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u7684\u4f4e\u4eae\u5ea6\u7aef\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

The turbulent timescale on the largest spatial scale has been found to be ~500 Myr . This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field.

Aims. This study aims to compile and release a catalogue of all AGN observations conducted with JWST. Using eJWST, we systematically filter and organize these observations to facilitate access and retrieval of all of JWST's data products related to AGNs. Our goal is to provide the community with a valuable resource for their research. Methods.

We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \\sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \\sim 53^\\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} \\sim 15\\% \\, {\\rm \\dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\\rm e} \\sim 10^{21} \\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features.

Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684HII\u533aNGC 7538\u4e2d\u6b21\u7ea7\u6052\u661f\u5bf9\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u70ed\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b21\u7ea7\u6052\u661f\u5bf9HII\u533aNGC 7538\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9NGC 7538\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387H\u03b1 Fabry-Perot\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9ad8\u65af\u62df\u5408\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u68af\u7ed3\u6784\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0NGC 7538\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u4e8e11 km/s\u7684\u84dd\u79fb\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u6d41\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u6e4d\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u7531IRS1\u7684\u6d41\u51fa\u548cIRS6\u7684\u5f13\u5f62\u6fc0\u6ce2\u53e0\u52a0\u5f15\u8d77\u3002", "conclusion": "HII\u533aNGC 7538\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u51fa\u548c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u53e0\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b21\u7ea7\u6052\u661f\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs.

The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \\pm 0.2)\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{ph}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $\u03b3$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $\u03b3$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $\u03b3$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8d39\u7c73-LAT\u548cSwift-XRT/UVOT\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u8000\u53d8\u4f53S5 1044+71\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u548c\u6700\u77ed\u53d8\u65f6\u68074.5\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u64ce\u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8000\u53d8\u4f53S5 1044+71\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0e\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u67903\u5929\u5206\u7bb1\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Swift-XRT/UVOT\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf/UV/\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u5e03(SED)\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u6b21\u4e3b\u8981\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u53d8\u65f6\u68074.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1bX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ede\u540e\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf42.5\u5929\uff1bSED\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6301\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6001\u4e0b\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u66f4\u786c\u3001\u78c1\u5f3a\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8000\u53d8\u4f53S5 1044+71\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5bbd\u7ebf\u533a\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u661f\u9645\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762CO\u5728ASW\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u5792\uff0c\u63ed\u793aASW\u8868\u9762\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5929\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u9645\u5c18\u57c3\u8868\u9762\u5316\u5b66\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u5792\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u7269\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8131\u9644\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752822\u5206\u5b50\u6c34\u7c07\u4ee3\u8868ASW\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97CO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u5792\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u786e\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u901f\u7387\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86ASW\u8868\u9762\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8868\u9762\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdCO\u7684\u8131\u9644\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u661f\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4ecb\u5bfc\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u5929\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff09\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon.

We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst.

We investigate the radio loudness ($\\mathcal{R}$) distribution in a large, homogeneous sample of radio galaxies. Methods. The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($\u03bb$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $\u03bb$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $\u03bb$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously.

These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\u03c3$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\u03b3$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\u03b3$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $\u03b3$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e8625\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\u9ad8\u540c\u6b65\u5cf0\u503cBL Lac\u5929\u4f53\uff08EHBLs\uff09\u768416\u5e74Fermi-LAT\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u6e90\u5728GeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u4f4e\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec56\u4e2a\u6e90\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u8c31\u7b26\u5408\u786c\u5e42\u5f8b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u5149\u5b50\u6307\u6570\u96c6\u4e2d\u57281.7-1.8\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u5bbd\u5e26SED\u62df\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5355\u533a\u540c\u6b65+\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u8db3\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u5927\u591a\u6570EHBLs\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8f83\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u540c\u6b65\u5cf0blazars\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790EHBLs\u7684\u957f\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752816\u5e74Fermi-LAT\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6587\u732e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u679025\u4e2aEHBLs\u7684GeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5bbd\u5e26SED\u5e76\u7528\u5355\u533a\u540c\u6b65+SSC\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570EHBLs\u5728GeV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u6307\u65701.7-1.8\u3002SED\u62df\u5408\u663e\u793a\u5355\u533a\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570EHBLs\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u55b7\u6d41\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u78c1\u5316\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "EHBLs\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6BL Lacs\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u7279\u6027\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u78c1\u5316\u3002"}}

Notably, the new COLIBRE simulations have succeeded in reconciling this tension, though the precise reason for their improved agreement with JWST data remains unclear. We demonstrate that the improved agreement is largely due to super-Eddington growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. We run a series of $(100~\\mathrm{cMpc})^{3}$ simulations with the COLIBRE subgrid physics, varying the maximum allowed BH accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate. We show that only the fiducial COLIBRE model, which permits super-Eddington accretion, is consistent with the JWST constraints at $z \\gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about $50$ per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time.

In this second paper, we study the structural relations between baryonic mass, half-mass radius, and mean surface density to constrain possible morphological transformations between star-forming and passive galaxies. We complemented the SPARC sample with $\\sim$1200 passive galaxies that are nearly devoid of gas: ellipticals (Es), lenticulars (S0s), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) or dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and the so-called `ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs). Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) passive stellar components follow four distinct relations at high statistical significance, namely (i) ellipticals plus bulges, (ii) S0 disks, (iii) non-nucleated dwarfs (dEs, dSphs, UDGs), and (iv) nucleated dEs; (2) star-forming HSD disks (mostly Sa to Sc) overlap with S0 disks within 2$\u03c3$ in the baryonic relations and within 1$\u03c3$ in the stellar ones, so present-day spirals may simply evolve into lenticulars as they run out of gas; (3) star-forming LSD disks (mostly Sd to dI) are offset from non-nucleated passive dwarfs at more than 3$\u03c3$ in the baryonic relations, but the two galaxy populations overlap within 1$\u03c3$ in the stellar relations, suggesting that non-nucleated passive dwarfs may form from star-forming dwarfs only after gas removal; (4) UDGs extend the sequence of non-nucleated dEs/dSphs and may originate from the most diffuse star-forming LSD galaxies with no need for a substantial expansion of the stellar component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u91cd\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u534a\u8d28\u91cf\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u88ab\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ece\u6d3b\u8dc3\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u800c\u6765\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ece\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u5230\u65e0\u6c14\u4f53\u88ab\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790SPARC\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u8865\u5145\u7684\u7ea61200\u4e2a\u88ab\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u91cd\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534a\u8d28\u91cf\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a(1)\u88ab\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7fa4\u7ec4\uff1b(2)\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0eS0\u661f\u7cfb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u6e90\uff1b(3)\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u53ef\u80fd\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u65e0\u6838\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff1b(4)\u8d85\u5f25\u6563\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ef6\u4f38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u5f25\u6563\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u65e0\u9700\u6052\u661f\u6210\u5206\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7LISA\u4efb\u52a1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684EMRIs\uff08\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u87ba\u65cb\uff09\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6a21\u62dfEMRI\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LISA\u5bf9\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u6790\u7fa4\u4f53\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "EMRIs\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u5fc3\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LISA\u4efb\u52a1\u68c0\u6d4b\u591aEMRI\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u7edf\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u62df\u7684EMRI\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u8d28\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ca\u6545\u610f\u8bef\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea620\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u4ecd\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86EMRI\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaLISA\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Cluster membership was robustly determined through a probabilistic proper-motion analysis, yielding statistically significant samples of 600, 1042, and 907 stars, respectively. From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope.
