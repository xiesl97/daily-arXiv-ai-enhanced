The majority of previous work has utilised N-body\nsimulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.\nHere, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback\nfrom massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also\nscale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or\nfaster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We\nfind that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink\nparticles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a\nsimulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we\nwould expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the\ndynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities\ndirectly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with\n(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback\nprocesses does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the\nexpansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions."}

The chromospheric\nreconnection is in full swing when the colliding magnetic patches are still\nseparated by a granular cell at the photosphere. In a later phase, photospheric\ncancellation takes place with submergence of the closed magnetic loops linking\nthe opposite polarities. We carry out comparisons with the observations of the\nphotospheric magnetic flux loss rates, as well as of the horizontal magnetic\nfield and vertical velocity at the polarity inversion line. The reconnection\noutflows cause intensity brightenings, jets and different spectral features in\nthe synthesized chromospheric spectral lines, strongly reminiscent of those\nfound in recent observations. Coherent, twisted magnetic flux ropes are created\nby the flows associated with the process. Including coronal levels is crucial\nfor proper modeling, even if no major ejection or brightening is produced in\nthe corona in this event."}

This implies that, when\naveraging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local\nnonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so\nthat the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological\nPrinciple -- a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In\nprevious works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3\ncatalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\\sim\n10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise\nluminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few\nyears, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the\nHubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only.

Although trace amounts of water are seen across all\nphases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes\nundetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to\nplanets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and\n(exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water\nmolecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue\nratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to\nanswer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an\nenhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O\nratio of $(3.2 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in\nprotostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than\nexpected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest\nisotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \\pm 1.0) \\times $HDO/H$_2$O further\nestablishes the inheritance of water.

At a certain point, the\nstability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star\nto explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of\nnon-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time,\nresulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few\ntenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s\nbetween the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the\ngamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be\nnaturally explained.

We observe a flatter MZR\nslope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed\nto selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III]\nflux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on\nthe FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic\nhigh-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation\nwhere SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an\nintrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity\nvariations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat\nintrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these\nredshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in\nlow-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet\nto probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully\nselected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight\nconstraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay\nbetween gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies."}

In the present paper we remove all simplifying assumptions of\nour previous work Gaitanas et. al., 2024, and show how to compute analytical\nsolutions describing a 3-dimensional perturbation of the system from the SSES\nin the framework of two distinct theories, called `linear' and `nonlinear'.\nLinear theory stems from averaging the equations of motion over the primary's\nrapid rotation angle.

As a\nbasic application, we compute analytical solutions representing various\npossible Didymos-Dimorphos post-impact orbital and rotational states.

The majority of previous work has utilised N-body\nsimulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.\nHere, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback\nfrom massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also\nscale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or\nfaster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We\nfind that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink\nparticles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a\nsimulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we\nwould expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the\ndynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities\ndirectly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with\n(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback\nprocesses does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the\nexpansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions."}

The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the\nshearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary\ncenter-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this\nframework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the\nexpense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the\nshearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of\nthe embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by\nidentifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer\nthan the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various\nAGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of\nradii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably\nneglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce\na systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they\naim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will\nprove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic\nfields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole\nbinary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks."}

The predicted oxygen abundance exceeds observational inferences\nby about 0.5 dex, suggesting either overly efficient enrichment or weak\nfeedback. However, applying the O32 diagnostic directly to our synthetic\nspectra shows an offset of 1 dex from the correct outputted gas-phase\nmetallicity. This suggests that O32 is biased high at a level that is more than\nsufficient to account for the simulation-observation offset.

A recent\noutstanding example is the Type Ia SN \"H0pe\" ($z=1.78$), discovered in James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by\nthe galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a\nnew strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple\nimages of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of\nconstraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface\nbrightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model\nparameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the\nspatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the\nposition of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction\nestimate at $\\lesssim1\\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on\nspectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model\nof G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the\nimage plane to the source plane.
