Abstract: Small-scale jet-like eruptions, such as picoflare jets and jetlets, are recognized as potential contributors to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, yet their physical origin is still not fully established. Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire. This association suggests that flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights may produce coupled bright-dark structures, providing a plausible mechanism for the generation of picoflare jets. Our results demonstrate Solar Orbiter's ability to resolve the dynamics of small-scale jets and place new constraints on their origin.

TL;DR: 对43个白矮星双星系统的研究表明，日食时间变化的主要驱动机制可能与Applegate或Lanza机制有关，而非行星假说。部分辐射伴星的系统显示出更高的变化水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示白矮星双星系统中观察到的日食时间变化的驱动机制，比较行星假说与Applegate/Lanza机制的适用性。

Method: 利用ULTRACAM、ULTRASPEC和HiPERCAM获取的长期高速测光数据，分析43个系统的日食时间变化趋势及其演化。

Result: 研究发现，部分辐射伴星的系统在超对流边界外显示出更高的日食时间变化水平，支持Applegate或Lanza机制为主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 尽管Applegate/Lanza机制无法解释大多数系统中快速且大幅度的日食时间变化，但它仍是主要的驱动机制。行星假说的适用性较低。

Abstract: The overwhelming majority of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) binary systems show quasi-periodic variations in eclipse timings on many year timescales. Currently, the mechanism behind these eclipse time variations (ETVs) is not known, with the main competing theories being the planetary hypothesis and the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems, the vast majority of which have more than a decade of eclipse timing measurements, analysing their global properties to determine which driving force is the likely origin of the observed ETVs. Long-term, high-speed photometry data obtained with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM have allowed us to track the evolution of the ETVs in these systems, and analyse any previously unseen trends. From this analysis, we find a clear difference in the level of observed ETVs past the fully convective boundary, where systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently showing high levels of variation. While some systems may be affected by the presence of an unknown planet, the results from this study strongly indicates that an Applegate- or Lanza-like mechanism is the most likely driving force for the timing variations seen in the majority of systems in this sample. However, as found in previous studies, the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are still not able to reproduce the large and rapid timing variations seen in the vast majority of systems, with the companion star to the WD unable to provide sufficient energy on these short timescales.

### [3] [The SB9 catalogue: status, comparison with non-single stars from Gaia DR3 and evolution to SBX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17870)

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: SB9是一个包含约4000个光谱双星系统的综合目录，通过与Gaia DR3的交叉匹配更新了天体测量参数，并与Gaia的非单星目录进行了比较，突出了两者的互补性。SB9将升级为SBX，提供更现代的数据库和界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 更新SB9目录，通过与Gaia DR3的数据整合提升光谱双星系统的研究准确性和覆盖范围，并为未来的SBX目录奠定基础。

Method: 通过位置分离、视星等和自行反向传播与Gaia DR3进行严格交叉匹配，识别并更新SB9中的双星系统。

Result: SB9更新后包含4003个系统，其中3976个在Gaia DR3中有标识。827个双星与Gaia NSS目录共同匹配，655个可靠。SB9将升级为SBX。

Conclusion: SB9与Gaia DR3的结合为双星研究提供了基准样本，未来SBX将通过现代数据库和界面进一步提升数据质量和可访问性。

Abstract: The Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9) is a comprehensive compilation of spectroscopic binaries (SBs) with orbital parameters sourced from literature, comprising approximately 4000 systems (2800 single-lined and 1200 double-lined). This work presents the latest status of SB9 after two decades of development, detailing the statistical properties of SBs through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage. We performed a rigorous cross-match with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to update astrometric parameters and compare SB9 with the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) catalogue. Our methodology utilized positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation for identification. The final SB9 version updated by D. Pourbaix includes 4003 systems, including higher-order multiples: 152 triples, 71 quadruples, and 14 higher-order systems. Of these, 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers; 21 are too bright and six too faint for detection. Ten SB9 systems with periods exceeding 1180 days were spatially resolved by Gaia DR3. We identified a common sample of 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 considered highly reliable based on period and eccentricity differences under 10%. The limited overlap (20-30% of SB9) results from NSS selection cuts, brightness limits, and temporal baselines. This study highlights the complementary strengths of both catalogues and establishes a benchmark sample for binary star research. Finally, this work marks the transition of SB9 into SBX (The eXtended Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits), featuring a modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory access standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community.

### [4] [Modeling brightness temperature of sunspots using ALMA single-dish observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18069)
*F. Matković,R. Brajša,A. O. Benz,H. -G. Ludwig,C. L. Selhorst,I. Skokić,D. Sudar,A. Hanslmeier*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 对太阳黑子在0.3-10mm波长范围内的亮度温度进行了建模，通过ALMA单碟测量和其他仪器数据，改进了现有的ATLCW模型，发现在密度和温度方面的调整仍不足以完全匹配观测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过改进现有的ATLCW太阳黑子模型，更好地解释太阳黑子在毫米和亚毫米波段下的亮度温度变化。

Method: 基于ATLCW模型，通过最小二乘法在密度和温度上进行拟合，调整模型参数以匹配ALMA和其他仪器的观测数据。

Result: 改进后的模型显示太阳黑子密度比原始ATLCW模型低3.6-4.0倍，但比宁静太阳高1.4-1.8倍；温度比ATLCW预测高1.2倍，但比宁静太阳低1.2倍。然而，仍存在与观测数据的不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管密度和温度参数的优化改进了模型，但仍需进一步修正ATLCW模型和建模假设以完全匹配观测结果。

Abstract: We model sunspot brightness temperature in the wavelength range 0.3-10mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) single-dish measurements together with other instruments. Our modeling idea starts from an existing model, the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-Wülser (ATLCW) model for sunspots. The original model is then modified in density and temperature with a constant factor over all heights. A least-square fit in both density and temperature to the observed values yields an improved model for sunspot brightness temperature. Observations show that sunspots are darker than QS at wavelengths below 2 mm and brighter beyond, while fitting of the ATLCW sunspot model imply that sunspots should be darker than QS over the entireALMArange. The best-fitted sunspot brightness temperature profiles resulted in 3.6-4.0 times lower sunspot density compared to the original sunspot ATLCW model, or 1.4-1.8 times higher density compared to QS. The temperature came out around 1.2 times higher than the original ATLCW predictions for sunspots, or 1.2 times lower than QS temperature. Even with improved density and temperature parameters, the remaining discrepancy between the bestfitted models and observations indicated that additional improvements are needed in the ATLCW model and modeling assumptions.

### [5] [The attempted polarity reversal and evolving magnetic environment of AD Leo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18085)
*K. G. Smith,D. Evensberget,S. Bellotti,J. Morin,A. A. Vidotto,B. J. S. Pope*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: AD Leo的大规模磁场虽从强负演变为弱负，但未发生极性反转；其磁场趋于简单配置，且质量流失率高于太阳，宜居带外的行星可能免受恒星风影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究M矮星AD Leo的大规模磁场演化及其对空间天气环境的影响，特别是可能存在的极性反转现象及其对宜居带行星的影响。

Method: 利用ESPaDOnS和SPIRou在2022年末和2023年初的光谱偏振数据，计算纵向磁场并通过Zeeman-Doppler成像重建大规模磁场；结合2019至2023年的五个磁图，使用SWMF模拟三维Alfven波驱动的恒星风。

Result: AD Leo的大规模磁场更倾向于高度轴对称的极向偶极场，平均磁场强度增加，但未发生极性反转；恒星质量流失率约为太阳的十倍，宜居带位于Alfven表面之外，行星可能免受恒星风侵蚀。

Conclusion: AD Leo的磁场演化未导致极性反转，而是恢复为简单配置；其空间天气环境对宜居带行星的影响较小，磁场轴对称性变化导致不同时期的条件差异。

Abstract: In the past two decades, the observed large-scale magnetic field of the active M dwarf star AD Leo has evolved from strongly to mildly negative, raising a suspicion that it might switch polarity. Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field.

TL;DR: 首次应用TRIP软件并行求解3D非局部热力学平衡辐射传输问题，验证了PRD和3D结构对太阳大气散射偏振的影响，展示了磁场对偏振信号的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳强共振线的线性散射偏振信号对研究外层太阳大气磁场有潜力，但此前因计算复杂而难以建模。

Method: 使用TRIP软件，结合3D太阳大气模型和PRD效应，合成Ca I 4227 Å线的斯托克斯轮廓，并采用预处理的Krylov方法大规模并行计算。

Result: PRD和3D结构的联合作用在谱线翼区生成了对磁场和速度梯度敏感的散射偏振信号，CRD近似低估了线核心信号幅度。

Conclusion: 该研究为通过合成与观测数据的定量比较诊断太阳色球和过渡区的磁场提供了关键进展。

Abstract: Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 Å in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 通过交叉匹配Prsa等人(2022)的食双星目录与LAMOST中分辨率光谱，研究了11个目标的光变和视向速度曲线，获得了精确物理参数，揭示其演化状态和轨道周期变化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是利用LAMOST光谱数据结合光变和视向速度曲线分析，精确确定11个食双星的物理参数，并探讨其演化状态和轨道周期变化的机制。

Method: 方法包括交叉匹配LAMOST中分辨率光谱与食双星目录，分析光变和视向速度曲线以获取物理参数，并结合质量-光度、质量-半径关系及O-C分析研究演化状态和轨道周期变化。

Result: 结果显示目标包括深、中、浅接触双星各3、3、5个；3个目标存在O'Connell效应，1个为低质量比深接触双星；O-C分析表明5个目标轨道周期长期减小，4个增加，3个周期变化可能源于Applegate机制或光时效应。

Conclusion: 结论认为这些食双星的轨道周期变化由质量转移和角动量损失共同驱动，同时暗示部分目标可能为双星合并候选体。

Abstract: By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog provided by Prsa et al. (2022) with LAMOST medium resolution spectra, we obtained 11 targets. Combining light and radial velocity curves analysis, we have derived accurate physical parameters for these 11 targets. The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect.

### [8] [Power-law Indices of EUV Intensity Power Spectrum in Flaring Coronal Active Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18133)
*Sihui Zhong,Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov,Valery M. Nakariakov*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: This study examines the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-active regions, finding that deviations in these indices, especially $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$, may serve as precursors to solar flares.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore how the spatial and temporal evolution of power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity spectra can reveal dynamics and potential flare precursors in active solar regions.

Method: The study analyzed the power-law indices ($\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{hf}$) of EUV intensity power spectra in 14 flare events, focusing on their spatial distributions and temporal variations before flares.

Result: Deviations in $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ consistently occurred at flare sites minutes before flares, and changes in $\alpha_\mathrm{lf} - \alpha_\mathrm{hf}$ were detected up to 90 minutes prior. These variations may indicate flare precursors.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that temporal changes in power-law indices could serve as short-term flare precursors, though validation with larger samples is needed.

Abstract: Solar intensity power spectra are usually characterised by coloured noise, with the spectral energy following a segmented power-law function of frequency, $S(f)\propto f^{-α}$, over different frequency ranges. Typically, the power-law index exceeds 1 in the low-frequency part ($α_\mathrm{lf}$) and is around 0 at high frequencies ($α_\mathrm{hf}$). This work investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions. The spatial distribution of the power-law index in the low-frequency domain ($α_\mathrm{lf}$) closely mirrors EUV intensity images, indicating that $α_\mathrm{lf}$ can reveal the dynamics of coronal plasma structures. Temporally, $α_\mathrm{lf}$ remains stable in quiescent active regions, but it exhibits significant variability before the flare onset. Motivated by this behaviour, we analysed 14 flare events, quantifying the temporal variation of the indices $α_\mathrm{lf}$ and $α_\mathrm{hf}$ as potential flare precursors. In all flare events considered, notable deviations of $α_\mathrm{lf}$ beyond a defined threshold consistently occurred at the flare site within a few minutes before the flare. In some cases, the change in the value of $α_\mathrm{lf} - α_\mathrm{hf}$ was detected within 30--90\, minutes before the flare. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the temporal variation of the power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra could potentially serve as short-term precursors of solar flares, which needs to be validated on a larger flare sample.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的深度学习方法（cINN），用于高效分析4MOST高分辨率恒星光谱，可以快速估计恒星参数和化学丰度，并计算后验分布和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代光谱巡天获取数百万恒星光谱，但传统方法计算成本高。为了解决这一问题，研究者开发了一种高效深度学习模型，以应对未来大规模高分辨率光谱数据。

Method: 使用Turbospectrum生成的NLTE合成光谱模拟4MOST观测，训练cINN模型预测恒星参数和化学丰度，同时估计后验分布和不确定性。

Result: 模型在S/N=250时的误差为33 K（Teff）、0.16 dex（log(g)）、0.12 dex（[Fe/H]）等。验证表明与独立代码TSFitPy结果一致，且可加速处理4MOST光谱。

Conclusion: NLTE cINN模型高效且稳健，未来可快速分析4MOST大规模光谱数据。

Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys obtain spectra for millions of stars. However, classical spectroscopic methods can often be computationally expensive, rendering them impractical for the analysis of large datasets. We introduce a novel simulation-based deep-learning approach for the efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra to be obtained with the upcoming high-resolution 4MOST spectrograph. We used a suite of synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations and trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for the purpose of predicting self-consistently stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances. The cINN is a neural network architecture that estimates full posterior distributions for the target stellar properties, providing an intrinsic uncertainty estimate. We evaluated the predictive performance of the trained cINN model on both synthetic data and observed spectra of stars. We found that our new cINN trained on NLTE synthetic spectra is capable of recovering stellar parameters with average errors ($σ$) of $33$ K for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $0.16$ dex for $\log(g)$, and $0.12$ dex for [Fe/H], $0.1$ dex for [Ca/Fe], $0.11$ for [Mg/Fe], and $0.51$ dex for [Li/Fe], respectively, at a signal to noise ratio of 250 per Angstrom. From the analysis of the observed spectra of Gaia-ESO / 4MOST / PLATO benchmark stars, we verified that our NLTE estimates for stellar parameters and abundances are consistent with results obtained with the independent code TSFitPy. We conclude that the NLTE cINN is robust and can, theoretically, evaluate 4 million high-resolution 4MOST spectra in less than a day, using GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: 研究为第三代引力波天文台时代的谱警报器宇宙学提供了已验证的性能测试框架。

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) spectral sirens offer a promising method for measuring cosmological parameters using GW data only - without relying on external redshift information such as electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs - by exploiting distributional features in the population of GW sources. The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $Λ$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7<z<1.8$ with a catalog of $\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\sim 26%$ on $Ω_{\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $Ω_{\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories.

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range have long been considered a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we explore a sterile neutrino production mechanism through active neutrino self-interactions in the early universe, assuming that they constitute the full DM abundance. We implement a self-consistent treatment of the sterile-neutrino free streaming and the active-neutrino self-interactions on structure formation, which yield a unique scale-dependent modification to the linear matter power spectrum. We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$α$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator. We produce some of the most stringent observational constraints to date on sterile neutrino DM, comparable to the bounds from the most stringent laboratory constraints.

TL;DR: Dandelion实验首次利用方向探测技术搜索1 meV暗光子暗物质，通过球面镜将暗光子转化为毫米波光子，并用221个超导探测器（KIDs）在150-350 GHz频段探测。数据分析了1480分钟，处理了背景干扰，结果未发现暗光子信号，但对暗光子的动能混合参数χ给出了新的上限。

Motivation: 探索暗光子作为暗物质候选体的可能性，特别是在1 meV质量范围内的存在性及其性质。

Method: 使用球面镜将暗光子转化为毫米波光子，通过KIDs探测器阵列（221个）在150-350 GHz频段和150 mK低温下探测。采用去相关分析和主成分分析（PCA）去除背景噪声。

Result: 未探测到暗光子信号，但对动能混合参数χ在0.6-1.4 meV质量范围内给出了新的上限。

Conclusion: Dandelion实验首次在毫米波段利用KIDs阵列对暗光子暗物质进行了约束，结果为后续类似实验提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents the first results from the Dandelion experiment, a directional detection, which searches for 1 meV dark photon dark matter. We use a spherical mirror to convert dark photons into standard millimeter-wavelength photons that can then be detected with an array of 221 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) cooled down to 150 mK within the KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) camera and operating between 150 and 350 GHz. We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $χ$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 利用CMB各向异性数据，结合Planck和ACT DR6数据，通过MCMC方法更新了宇宙弦和超弦参数的约束条件，显著提高了弦张力的上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究对宇宙弦和超弦参数的约束较为宽松，本研究旨在利用更高质量的数据和方法进一步收紧这些约束，以更好地理解宇宙弦现象。

Method: 采用MCMC方法分析Planck温度与偏振数据以及ACT DR6数据，开发了改进版的CAMB（CAMBactive）用于计算CMB各向异性。

Result: 针对普通宇宙弦和宇宙超弦，分别将弦张力的$2σ$上限收紧至$Gμ<3.66\times10^{-8}$和$Gμ_F<1.38\times10^{-8}$。同时发现结果对先验条件有明显的依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了弦张力约束的精度，并公开了计算工具CAMBactive，为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $Gμ$, the string wiggliness parameter $α$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $Gμ_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2σ$ upper limits of $Gμ< 3.66\times10^{-8}$ and $Gμ_F < 1.38\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \texttt{CAMBactive} \cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}.

TL;DR: 研究了温度依赖的暗物质与中微子相互作用对宇宙学参数测量的影响，提出了新的Boltzmann层级方法，并通过CMB和BAO数据对相互作用参数进行了约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗物质与中微子的温度依赖相互作用如何影响宇宙学参数的测量，特别是中微子质量的效应。

Method: 采用维数六算子诱导的暗物质-中微子散射模型，推导了完整的Boltzmann层级，并提出了一种新的流体近似方法。

Result: 相互作用会引发暗声振荡，在CMB和物质功率谱上留下独特印记。最新数据约束显示，相互作用参数在正常中微子质量排序下达到$u^0_{χ-ν} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-13})$。

Conclusion: 研究强调了实际中微子质量排序在拟合中的重要性，并发现结合Planck、DESI和ACT数据时，存在95%置信水平下非零相互作用的迹象。

Abstract: We study the influence of the temperature-dependent interaction between dark matter (DM) and neutrinos on the measurement of cosmological parameters. We pay attention to the neutrino mass effects, so that the derivation of Boltzmann equations needs to specify the concrete form of interaction. We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{χ-ν} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects. We have investigated alternative scenarios with different neutrino mass assumptions. In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{χ-ν} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{χ-ν}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data.

TL;DR: 高分辨率L波段观测显示GJ 436 b可能存在热反转大气和水蒸气、甲烷分子特征，但进一步观测需验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GJ 436 b的大气特征，尤其是L波段高分辨率光谱对较小、较冷系外行星的潜力。

Method: 利用Keck II/KPIC进行高分辨率L波段观测，通过单模光纤降低背景噪声，结合大气模型分析与交叉相关技术。

Result: 检测到可能的H$_2$O和CH$_4$发射特征，且连续谱通量高于预期；需进一步观测确认热反转假说。

Conclusion: L波段高分辨率光谱有望拓展对小型冷系外行星的大气研究，但需后续观测验证结果。

Abstract: We present high spectral resolution $L$ band (2.91--3.85 $μ$m) observations of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b from Keck II/KPIC. KPIC's single-mode fiber feed reduces the $L$ band sky background by a factor of 100, significantly improving sensitivity compared to a seeing-limited spectrometer and enabling a tentative ($\rm SNR = 3-4$) cross-correlation detection of GJ 436 b with a thermally inverted atmospheric model. In contrast with recent results from $JWST$ and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, our retrieval analysis prefers the presence of H$_2$O, and possibly CH$_4$, molecular features in emission. The broad-band continuum flux associated with the maximum-likelihood model is substantially higher than expected based on both the $\sim670\rm\ K$ equilibrium temperature of GJ 436 b and previous results from low-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the loss of continuum information during the processing of high-resolution spectra makes our analysis effectively insensitive to the absolute continuum level of the planet, and that scaling the maximum-likelihood model to match the broad-band flux measured from low-resolution observations of GJ 436 b results in a detection of similar strength in cross-correlation. These results could be explained by a thermal inversion arising above a haze layer in the upper atmosphere of \gjb. Further observations, ideally post-eclipse in order to break the $K_p - Δv_{sys}$ degeneracy, are needed to clarify this possible detection. This work demonstrates the potential of $L$ band high-resolution spectroscopy for characterizing significantly smaller and cooler exoplanets compared with hot Jupiters.

Conclusion: 新框架适用于地月空间，提供高效的最小假设初始状态估计与不确定性管理。

Abstract: In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了不均匀电离大气中磁阻力对WASP-18 b行星气候动力学的影响，指出各向异性磁阻力和摩擦加热显著改变了高层大气的风和温度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期研究表明热木星大气中的电离现象可通过磁耦合影响行星动力学，但磁阻力对大气环流的具体影响仍未清晰。本研究旨在通过模拟约束WASP-18 b的磁场强度。

Method: 研究在3D大气环流模型ExoRad中实现了各向异性磁阻力（包括Pedersen和Hall分量）和摩擦加热的参数化，对比了不同阻力公式对气候特征的影响。

Result: 各向异性磁阻力和摩擦加热显著影响高层大气的风速和方向，改变昼夜环流，产生可观测的温度不对称性，并在晨昏交界处增强温差及形成两个偏离赤道的热点。

Conclusion: 磁阻力和摩擦加热通过局部电离效应塑造了WASP-18 b的动力学和温度分布，晨昏交界区域对磁阻力建模方式尤为敏感，为约束行星磁场强度提供了途径。

Abstract: Early studies of ionization in hot Jupiter atmospheres suggest that magnetic coupling can shape their dynamics. These effects may be most pronounced in ultra-hot Jupiters that sustain global magnetic fields. WASP-18 b hosts an ionized dayside atmosphere extending deep enough to be strongly influenced by magnetic forces. Phase curve observations suggest effective magnetic drag, yet its impact on the atmospheric circulation remains poorly constrained. This work explores how magnetic drag in an inhomogeneously ionized atmosphere shapes local and global dynamics to provide a pathway to constrain the planet's magnetic field strength. An analytical parameterization for anisotropic magnetic drag, including both Pedersen and Hall drag components, and associated frictional heating in the globally neutral atmosphere, is implemented in the 3D General Circulation Model ExoRad to study WASP-18 b's atmosphere. Climate characteristics are compared for different drag formulations to assess whether anisotropic physics is required to capture magnetic coupling effects. Anisotropic magnetic drag and frictional heating, both set by local ionization, strongly affect wind strength and direction in the upper atmosphere, modify the day-night circulation, and produce observable temperature asymmetries. They enhance the evening-morning terminator temperature difference near 0.1 bar and generate two off-equator hotspots with reduced eastward shift. The terminator regions are particularly sensitive to how magnetic drag is modeled. Anisotropic magnetic drag damps and redirects dayside-to-nightside winds, partially decoupling the equatorial flow at the morning terminator while maintaining the nightside jet. Locally varying drag forces and frictional heating create asymmetric temperature patterns manifesting as primary and secondary hotspot regions.

Motivation: 研究目标是为了验证TOI-5734b的行星性质，并测量其质量、大小和轨道参数，进而探讨其可能的组成和大气演化，以加深对年轻系外行星形成和演化的理解。

Method: 结合TESS光度法和HARPS-N径向速度数据，使用高斯过程（GPs）模型区分恒星活动和行星信号，同时精确测量行星的半径、质量和密度。

Result: 确认了TOI-5734b的行星性质，测量了其轨道周期（约6.18天）、半径（2.10±0.12地球半径）、质量（9.1±2.6地球质量）和密度（0.98±0.33地球密度），推测其接近岩石组成且几乎没有原始包层。

Conclusion: TOI-5734b的研究表明其适合用于当前和未来的大气研究，为年轻系外行星的组成和演化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Increasing interest in young exoplanets is leading to a growing effort to understand the formation and evolutionary processes responsible for their different architectures. One interesting target is TOI-5734, a relatively young K3-K4 dwarf star ($500_{-150}^{+300}$ Myr) showing a transiting candidate in photometric observations followed up with high-resolution spectroscopic data. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\rm b}\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\oplus$). By measuring its density ($ρ_{\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $ρ_\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope. Our results point toward the possibility of considering the target for atmospheric studies with present and future ground- and space-based facilities.

TL;DR: 大主带小行星（直径≥120 km）的表面成分随日心距离呈梯度变化，从无水到富含水合和可能氨化物。研究探讨这些天体是否通过向内迁移的雪线附近的卵石吸积获得挥发物，并与观测约束对比。

Motivation: 了解太阳系早期挥发物的分布和来源，揭示大主带小行星的成因及其对太阳系演化的意义。

Method: 模拟在雪线迁移过程中，岩石胚胎通过卵石吸积获取挥发物的过程，考虑湍流强度、径向卵石通量和卵石停止时间（St）等参数。

Result: 中等卵石通量（≲18 M⊕/Myr）可实现挥发物输送且避免小行星质量超过谷神星。水吸积需St∼10⁻³（~1 mm），而氨吸积需St∼10⁻⁴（~100 μm），且仅最大小行星（D>200 km）能积累足够氨。

Conclusion: 中等大小、可能含氨的小行星记录了太阳系的动态演化过程，但小粒径卵石的理论和观测挑战仍需解决。

Abstract: Large main-belt asteroids (diameter $D \gtrsim 120\ \mathrm{km}$) exhibit a surface composition gradient as a function of heliocentric distance, ranging from anhydrous bodies to those rich in hydrated and, possibly, ammoniated materials. Their primordial nature holds key clues to the evolution of the Solar System. It has been suggested that the volatile-rich bodies formed in the outer Solar System and were implanted into the main belt. Alternatively, volatiles may have been delivered via inward-drifting icy pebbles in the protosolar disk. Here, we examine whether in-situ formed rocky embryos can acquire volatiles through pebble accretion as the snowline migrated inward. With the turbulence strength of the disk, radial pebble flux, and the dimensionless stopping time of pebbles (St) as parameters, we calculate the growth of large asteroids. The results are then compared with mass and compositional constraints based on asteroid observations. We find that a moderate pebble flux ($\lesssim18~M_\oplus / \text{Myr}$) is required to enable volatile delivery while preventing the largest asteroids from becoming more massive than Ceres. Water accretion is feasible with $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 1$ mm). However, only the largest asteroids (D > 200 km) can accumulate sufficient ammonia under such conditions. For most asteroids with D between 100 and 200 km, ammonia ice accretion requires $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-4}$ ($\sim 100\,μ$m). Such small particle sizes may pose both theoretical and observational challenges. Thus, we propose that the intermediate-sized, potentially ammonia-bearing asteroids serve as a record of the Solar System's dynamic evolution.

Abstract: DMPP is a radial-velocity survey that aims to detect planets around stars exhibiting anomalous activity signatures, consistent with the presence of close-in evaporating planets. Here, we report the discovery of 7 new planetary signals in 5 different systems: DMPP-2c & d, HD67200/DMPP-6b & c, HD118006/DMPP-7b, HD191122/DMPP-8b, and HD200133/DMPP-9b. We update the orbital parameters of the DMPP-1, DMPP-2, and DMPP-3 systems, along with those of the planetary systems orbiting HD181433, HD39194, and HD89839. We derive detection limits for all 24 targets in our sample with adequate observational coverage, and test the DMPP hypothesis by calculating the occurrence rates for planets in this configuration. We find that the occurrence rates of planets in our sample with orbital periods shorter than $50~\mathrm{d}$ and masses in the range $3$-$10$ M$_\oplus$ are $83.0^{+27.1}_{-24.4}\%$, for $10$-$30$ M$_\oplus$ are $27.0^{+15.0}_{-11.2}\%$, and for $30$-$100$ M$_\oplus$ are $13.9^{+11.8}_{-7.5}\%$. This is significantly higher than the occurrence rates reported by other radial velocity surveys, providing strong support for the DMPP hypothesis.

Conclusion: 研究为磁星巨耀斑的综合物理模型提供了支持，并表明等离子体团驱动的冲击波可能是快速射电暴的机制之一。

Abstract: Gradual crustal deformation can generate strongly twisted magnetic fields around magnetars, potentially triggering giant flares with total energies exceeding $10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg}$. In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\sim 9\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts.

Motivation: 旨在利用覆盖完整太阳周期的时间分辨数据，评估太阳调制对宇宙射线传播的影响，优化传播模型的拟合精度。

Method: 采用两种代表性银河传播模型（对流主导和再加速主导）结合三种太阳调制方案（标准力场近似、带刚性断裂的扩展力场模型、HelMod代码），并整合时间分辨的反质子数据。

Result: 标准力场近似在对流主导模型中可较好描述正电荷核子（太阳极大期除外），但对反质子无效；再加速模型中太阳调制与低能传播的强简并性导致非物理解。系统误差达10-15%，显著限制测量精度。

Conclusion: 现有调制模型的不足导致显著系统误差，未来需22年太阳周期的时变测量以降低不确定性。

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在中子星-黑洞（NSBH）并合过程中探测动态相变的可行性，提出了一个波形模型TROYE，并通过模拟实验验证了在高级LIGO设计灵敏度下可以检测到相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 致密核物质的物态方程（EoS）是高能天体物理学中的一个重要问题。虽然静态EoS模型受到双中子星（BNS）并合观测的限制，但动态相变在并合过程中发生的可能性尚未在标准引力波（GW）分析中得到充分研究。NSBH系统因其避免了双星系统的参数退化和单星潮汐演化的可分离性，被视为一个更干净的实验平台。

Method: 论文提出了一个现象学波形模型TROYE，该模型在时域中将两个波形近似拼接在一起，以模拟晚期旋近过程中两个物态方程之间的平滑但快速的相变。作者使用bilby推断库对100个模拟事件进行了全面的贝叶斯注入和恢复实验。

Result: 结果显示，在高级LIGO设计灵敏度下，潮汐形变参数$Λ$的位移达到$|ΔΛ| \gtrsim 400$时，可以显著检测到相变（$\ln B > 5$）。此外，研究还发现“软化”相变（$Λ$减小）比“硬化”相变更容易检测，并提出相变的恢复能力在缝合时间和双星质量比的不确定性下依然保持稳定。

Conclusion: NSBH系统为研究动态相变提供了优越的实验环境，TROYE模型和贝叶斯分析方法证明了在现有设备条件下对相变的可探测性。这些发现为未来引力波数据分析提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: The Equation of State (EoS) of dense nuclear matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in high-energy astrophysics. While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\tildeΛ(Λ_1,Λ_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|ΔΛ| \gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\ln B > 5$). We further identify a "V-shape" asymmetry in detectability, where "softening" transitions (decreasing $Λ$) are systematically easier to detect than "stiffening" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present "stress tests" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio.

### [24] [Updated Air-Shower $X_{\rm max}$ Moment Parametrizations for UHECR Composition with Latest Hadronic Interaction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18118)
*Carmelo Evoli,Igor Vaiman,Sergio Petrera,Francesco Salamida*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究通过CONEX模拟了高能宇宙射线（UHECRs）在三种强子相互作用模型下的空气簇射行为，更新了$X_{\\rmmax}$矩和分布的参数化模型，适用于精确的成分研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了精确推断UHECRs的质量组成，需要基于真实空气簇射模拟快速准确地映射$X_{\\rmmax}$矩与质量对数矩$\lnA$之间的关系。

Method: 使用CONEX模拟质子至铁核引发的空气簇射，拟合了$X_{\\rmmax}$的均值、方差及全分布的三参数广义Gumbel函数，并在三种强子模型（EposLHC-R、Sibyll2.3e、QGSJet-III-01）下验证。

Result: 参数化模型的残差在均值上为几gcm$^{-2}$，方差上为几(gcm$^{-2}$)$^2$，验证了其在UHECR精确成分研究中的适用性。

Conclusion: 更新的参数化模型为UHECR质量组成的精确分析和$X_{\\rmmax}$分布的正向折叠提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is commonly inferred from the first two moments of the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\rm max}$, measured by fluorescence and hybrid detectors. Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\langle X_{\rm max}\rangle$ and the variance $σ^2(X_{\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\rm max}$ distributions.

Abstract: The existence of a distinct mass boundary between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes remains in question. It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses.

TL;DR: 摘要研究了热吸积流中冷团的演化，发现冷团形成后会向外移动，而非直接向黑洞运动，原因是粘性扭矩和外层热气凝结导致角动量略超开普勒速度。冷团达到平衡位置后在内缘开始分裂，碎片依次向内运动。冷团的运动与外层冷盘更接近，而非周围的亚开普勒热吸积流。

Method: 通过流体动力学模拟研究冷团的演化，分析其运动轨迹、角动量特性及分裂行为。

Result: 冷团形成后向外移动，而非直接向内；其角动量略超开普勒速度，分裂后的碎片依次向内运动；运动特性与外层冷盘更接近。

Conclusion: 冷团的演化行为支持Wang等人（2012）弱耦合情况的半解析结果，揭示了热吸积流中物质转移的复杂动力学过程。

Abstract: Previous numerical simulations have shown that cold clumps can form within hot accretion flows, offering insights into the detailed processes of the state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012).

Motivation: 研究旨在通过改进参考框架的对齐方法，解决X射线自行运动测量中因观测对齐不确定性导致的精度限制问题。

Method: 利用Gaia星表中的未分辨X射线流量及X射线明亮点源进行观测对齐，从而减少框架对齐的不确定性。

Result: 测量结果显示绝对位置参考Gaia的典型天体测量精度约为10 mas，PM统计不确定性最低为1.3 mas yr⁻¹，确认了一个新的X射线纤维结构，并揭示了多个脉冲星的风星云结构和起源。

Conclusion: 改进的参考框架对齐使PM精度显著提高，目前多数情况下精度限制主要来自于脉冲星自身流量。该成果为脉冲星及其风星云研究提供了重要数据。

Abstract: We present X-ray proper motion (PM) measurements of 19 pulsars using new and archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including pulsar wind trails and X-ray filaments. Precise X-ray PMs are often limited by uncertainties in aligning observations to a common reference frame. Our analysis uses unresolved X-ray flux from stars in the Gaia catalog in addition to X-ray bright point sources for alignment, improving uncertainties. We obtain absolute positions referenced to Gaia with typical astrometric precision $\sim$10 mas and PM statistical uncertainties down to 1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$, the most precise X-ray PM achieved to date. With our improved frame alignment, PM accuracies are now limited by the pulsar flux in most cases. These results reveal a new X-ray filament and illuminate the wind nebula structures and origins of several of these pulsars.

Method: 使用贝叶斯推断框架，估计基于过去65年中至少一次未检测接触的技术特征的当前可探测性。

Result: 结果显示，在地球附近几百光年内实现高可探测性需要极大数量的未检测接触，远超过该范围内的宜居行星数量。

Conclusion: 若过去银河系内确有未检测到的接触，最佳探测机会可能需扩展到几千光年范围，但预计可检测的技术发射数量仍有限。

Abstract: In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), the highly incomplete sampling of the technosignature search space is often considered as a plausible explanation for the persistent lack of detections over six decades of searches. If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected.

Abstract: We present a new approach to identify satellite trails (or other linear artifacts) in ACS/WFC imaging data using a modified Radon Transform. We demonstrate that this approach is sensitive to features with mean brightness significantly below the background noise level, and it is resistant to the influence of bright astronomical sources (e.g., stars, galaxies) in most cases. Comparing with a set of satellite trails identified by eye, we find a trail recovery rate of 85\% and a false detection rate (after removing diffraction spikes that are easily filtered) of 2.5\%. By performing an analysis using a much larger ACS/WFC data set where false trails are identified by their persistence across multiple images of the same field, we identify the Radon Transform parameter space and image properties where our algorithm is unreliable, and estimate a false detection rate of $\sim10\%$ elsewhere. We apply our method to ACS/WFC data taken between 2002 and 2022 to determine both the frequency of satellite trail contamination in science data and also the typical trail brightness as a function of time. We find the rate of satellite trail contamination has increased by approximately a factor of two in the last two decades, but there is no clear systematic evolution in the typical trail brightness. Our satellite trail identification program is available as part of the \texttt{acstools} package.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin observatory is expected to produce 10 million transient alerts per night in ugrizy filters, whilst Euclid is a visible to near-infrared space telescope engaged in a wide field survey. We present a prototype system to automatically match the transient alerts from Rubin to Euclid observations. The system produces joint light-curves containing both visible and near-infrared photometry, and joint image cutouts. Using Zwicky Transient Facility alerts as a proxy for Rubin, we demonstrate the system in use in cases where Euclid did and did not detect the transient and highlight the value that can be added in each case. For transients detected by Euclid these benefits include identifying the supernovae (SNe) in observations taken prior to ground-based detection, thereby better constraining the explosion time, such as SN 2024pvw detected ~3 d prior to ground based detections. In cases where Euclid did not detect the transient, we demonstrate the benefit of adding Euclid observations to improve host morphology measurements and associations.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission aims to detect gravitational waves by interferometrically measuring the change of separation between free-falling test masses (TMs). LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane.

Abstract: Detecting the global 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization remains a major observational challenge due to bright foregrounds and instrumental systematics. As part of the Colombian Antarctic Telescopes for 21 cm Absorption during Reionization (CANTAR) initiative, we present a simulation and analysis framework to evaluate antenna chromaticity, optimize instrument design, and assess site suitability for global 21 cm experiments. Using frequency-dependent beam models and Haslam-based sky maps, we compute dynamic spectra for the EDGES blade dipole and a set of dipole and novel monopole antennas optimized via particle swarm optimization. The optimized designs exhibit improved spectral smoothness compared to EDGES, particularly in the 70-120 MHz range. We also evaluate latitude-dependent sky brightness and identify mid-latitude sites (-40° to +5°) as optimal for foreground suppression. We apply Bayesian inference together with posterior predictive model validation to the publicly released EDGES data, assessing statistical consistency rather than hypothesis testing or model comparison. We find that physically motivated foreground and ionospheric models are statistically consistent with the data only when a 21 cm absorption feature is excluded. From the validated posterior, we generate a statistically validated ensemble of foreground corrections for use in beam-sky simulations. These results support a two-phase strategy for CANTAR: Antarctic deployments for calibration and testing, and future science operations at mid-latitude sites. Our framework provides a validated path toward robust foreground modeling, antenna design, and systematics control for global 21 cm signal detection.

Motivation: 探索年轻大质量星团中重复恒星碰撞对甚大质量恒星和中质量黑洞种子的形成机制及其效率。

Method: 使用TITANS套件的18次直接N-体模拟，模拟星团质量、半质量密度及高原始双星比例，以符合观测数据。

Result: 高密度星团中重复碰撞效率高，但大多数VMSs通过原始双星合并形成；仅少数VMSs通过碰撞形成且质量不足以成为IMBH种子；IMBHs主要通过恒星碰撞或黑洞合并形成。

Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $ρ_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $ρ_{\rm h}<500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}>1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.

Abstract: Star formation within filaments may arise due to the growth of cores according to linear perturbation theory. This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations.

Motivation: 研究星暴后星系中分子气体的激发状态及其与恒星形成的关系，以理解这些星系在星暴后阶段的演化机制。

Method: 使用ALMA对SQuIGGLE巡天中的9个红移0.7附近的富含气体的星暴后星系进行CO(5-4)观测，结合已有的CO(2-1)数据，分析其分子气体激发状态。

Result: 8/9的目标检测到CO(5-4)，大多数星系表现出中等激发（r52≈0.1-0.3）。恒星形成表面密度在0.01-1 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2范围内，未观察到r52与恒星形成的关系。仅一个AGN宿主星系表现出显著高的激发。

Conclusion: 多数富含气体的星暴后星系分子气体激发中等，恒星形成效率相对抑制，未发现隐藏的强烈星暴活动，表明这些星系在星暴后阶段的演化特征。

Abstract: Many post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ have been shown to retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs yet host low ongoing star formation, suggesting that the remaining gas may be inefficient at forming stars during the early post-burst phase. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(5-4) observations of nine gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, angu$\vec{L}$ar momentum, and Evolution (SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E) survey, providing a view of the molecular gas excitation in these systems. Combined with existing CO(2-1) data, we detect CO(5-4) in 8/9 targets and find that most have moderate CO excitation with $r_{52}\equiv L'_{\rm CO(5-4)}/L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}\approx0.1-0.3$. These systems show no clear trend between $r_{52}$ and either total or surface-density of star formation. Specifically, all objects have $Σ_{\mathrm{SFR}} \sim 0.01-1\ \text{M}_\odot\ \text{yr}^{-1}\ \text{kpc}^{-2}$, consistent with compact, modest star formation, even when allowing for buried activity, as these galaxies decline from their peak. One object J1448+1010, which has clear optical, mid-infrared, and radio indicators of an active galactic nucleus, is an outlier with $r_{52}\approx0.6$; its elevated excitation likely requires significant non-stellar heating, with a contribution from potentially obscured star formation. Together, most gas-rich SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E post-starbursts have moderately excited molecular gas alongside little to modest star-forming activity, indicating that the remaining gas hosts relatively suppressed star formation efficiencies instead of strong buried starburst activity.

Result: 57%的目标检测到NaI D吸收，30%呈现出蓝移外流；质量流失率在局部宇宙外最高。外流不足以永久抑制恒星形成，但可调控气体循环。

Conclusion: 中性气体外流不足以永久抑制恒星形成，而气体的循环进出可能是反馈调控的标志，维持静止星系的状态。

Abstract: Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|Δv|$ >~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have $Δv$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--$Δv$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into galaxy evolution and the mechanisms driving transitions between different galaxy morphologies, we analyse the connection between star formation rate and stellar mass for 231 galaxies spanning Hubble types E1-Sdm from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy Area survey using three complementary classification schemes. The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_α$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies.

Motivation: 确定UMa III/U1的旋转性质有助于估算其总质量，从而判断其是否为超暗弱矮星系或存在大量双星的星团。

Method: 对UMa III/U1的所有成员星拟合非旋转和旋转模型，并通过剔除可能污染星后的样本重复分析。

Result: 非旋转模型更受支持（5-12倍），且旋转质量下限和质光比表明UMa III/U1不太可能由旋转压力支撑。

Conclusion: UMa III/U1的性质仍不明确，但无论其为矮星系还是星团，旋转压力均不太可能起主要作用。

Abstract: We investigate the kinematics of the potential ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) UMa III/U1 using Bayesian inference to search for the signal of any potential intrinsic rotation. The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\sim 5-12 \times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations. We calculate a lower-bound rotational mass estimate for UMa III/U1 and a corresponding lower bound mass-to-light ratio of $ 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \mathrm{M_\odot} / \mathrm{L_\odot} $ for the total population. We conclude that UMa III/U1 still remains an ambiguous object with viable arguments for both the UFD and self-gravitating star cluster scenarios, however under both, UMa III/U1 is unlikely to be supported by rotational pressure.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive radio polarization study of the Perseus molecular cloud using wideband L-band observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our survey covers $\sim13.8$~deg$^2$ with a mean Stokes~$I$ sensitivity of $\sim80~μ$Jy~beam$^{-1}$, enabling the detection of 1410 compact radio sources. From this population, we construct a catalog of source properties, including positions, integrated flux densities, and spectral indices measured across nine spectral windows. The majority of sources exhibit negative spectral indices, consistent with non-thermal synchrotron emission. Using RM Synthesis and RM CLEAN techniques, we detect 205 polarized background sources above an $8σ$ threshold. This corresponds to a sampling density of $\sim14.8$~deg$^{-2}$, representing more than an order-of-magnitude increase compared to previous NVSS-based measurements. The resulting rotation measures exhibit coherent large-scale variations across the surveyed region, with additional small-scale structure superimposed. The enhanced sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sampling density of our observations enable a substantially improved mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component toward the Perseus molecular cloud compared to previous surveys.

Abstract: Deep radio surveys are now producing catalogues with millions of radio sources. Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named "odd radio circles" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.

Conclusion: 结论是MATLAS-42可能不遵循“失败星系”形成路径，其GC丰富度未来可能因GC蒸发或瓦解而降低，因此不太可能是此类UDG的低红移类似前身。

Abstract: To date, there has been significant interest in globular cluster (GC)-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and the evidence that they have formed via an unexpected, ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway. The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\rm R, \star}=2433\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\rm R,HI}=2423\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\rm GC}/M_\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs.

Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.

Method: 利用MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS早期数据及光学LSBG目录，进行表面亮度测光和HI光谱提取。

Result: 发现29个LSBGs，其中26个符合UDGs标准；HI探测的LSBGs气体更丰富，且在动力学上与Tully-Fisher关系一致。

Conclusion: HI观测是发现和表征低表面亮度宇宙的有效工具。

Abstract: Untargeted neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys are well suited to identifying low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) that are gas rich, and they offer a complementary view to optically selected populations. We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff > 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe.

Abstract: Ionised regions around OB-type stars are formed at an early stage of their evolution and are important to investigate the formation process of these objects. However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.

Motivation: 为了理解大质量恒星和星团的形成过程，需要动态研究质量组装。G316.8丝状结构提供了一个理想的实验室，因为它包含三个具有可比气体储量但演化阶段连续的亚区域。

Method: 利用Atacama Compact Array（1.3 mm）、Herschel和APEX/ArTéMiS数据，生成了高分辨率的温度和柱密度图，并结合稠密碎片统计、柱密度PDF和Δ方差分析量化了结构演化。

Result: 从年轻到演化区域，最大碎片质量从8增至490 M⊙，稠密气体质量分数（>0.5 g cm⁻²）从0.4%升至9.6%。N-PDF显示出次级幂律尾，Δ方差斜率逐渐变浅，表明亚秒差距结构的持续组装。

Conclusion: 研究表明G316.8丝状结构的不同演化阶段存在显著动态变化，未来ALMA数据将进一步揭示800 AU尺度上的质量组装动态。

Abstract: A dynamic view of mass assembly is essential for understanding the formation of massive stars and clusters. Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations. The G316.8 filament provides an ideal laboratory: a 14-pc nearly linear structure composed of three contiguous subregions with comparable molecular gas reservoirs (~10,000 $M_\odot$ each) but spanning a clear evolutionary sequence from an infrared dark cloud (young) through a massive young stellar object (intermediate) to an HII region (evolved). As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $Δ$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%. The N-PDF develops a secondary power-law tail and the $Δ$-variance slope becomes progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures. Our further ALMA 12m continuum and spectral line data will extend this dynamic scenarios down to 800 AU scale.
