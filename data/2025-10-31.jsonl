Here, we perform the image\nstacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest\nand homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results\nreveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band,\nwith a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We\nperform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive\na stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy\nis compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar\nmass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the\nlocal MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the\nexistence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of\nthe host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within\nthe first billion years after the Big Bang."}

MADs experience\npowerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole\nhorizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we\ndevelop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field\ntransport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with\ngeometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux\ntransport velocity, $v_\\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive\nprocesses. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where\nadvection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small\ndeviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\\Phi/V_k\\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the\nlocal Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a\nrecurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\\rm rec}\\sim1500\\, r_g/c$. This\ntimescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\\Phi$\nexplains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system\ntimescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field\nby performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then\nestimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of\nturbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity.

While flux eruptions excite large-scale\nnon-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic\nfield diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions.

In this paper, we study the implications of this\noverestimation for constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in\ncurrent and near-future cosmological surveys. For concreteness, we focus on kSZ\nvelocity reconstruction from a Vera Rubin Observatory-like survey in tandem\nwith contemporary cosmic microwave background measurements.

However, these collapsed volatiles\naccumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be\nre-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a\nsimple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with\nstochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism\nfor CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \\rm{km}$\ndiameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \\rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate\nobservable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets.

With an average physical resolution of 17\npc, this is one of the largest samples of highly resolved spectrally mapped\nextragalactic HII regions. Regions of all luminosities exhibit a characteristic\nemission profile described by a double Gaussian with a marginally resolved or\nunresolved core with radius <10 pc surrounded by a more extended halo of\nemission with radius 20-30 pc. Approximately 80% of the emission of a region\noriginates from the halo component. As a result of this compact structure, the\nluminosity-radius relations for core and effective radii of HII regions depend\nsensitively on the adopted methodology. Only the isophotal radius yields a\nrobust relationship in NGC 253, but this measurement has an ambiguous physical\nmeaning. We invert the measured emission profiles to infer density profiles and\nfind central densities of n_e = 10-100 cm-3.

The central\ndensity of HII regions correlates well with the surface brightness within the\neffective radius.

Here, we present data from the first two\nseasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02<z<0.06), which is responsible\nfor a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no\nsupernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES\nsurvey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper,\nincluding 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves\nof these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate\nthat the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various\nrate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor\nsuperclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN\nIa observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating\nhow the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and\nhighlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample\nof 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the\nShapley Supercluster."}

The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from\ndiscrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a\nsimple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the\ndistance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u)\nto detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical\nproperties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We\nbenchmark the method using mock datasets representative of\nhigh-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax\nuncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey.\nTests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and\npolarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective\nbackground-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The\ndependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization\namplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing\npolarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high\nGalactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic\nsolutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating\nits accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both\nmethods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is\nprior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number\nof clouds along the LOS.

Here, we address this key unsolved\nissue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow\ngalaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via\nabundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of\ntheir host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the\nempirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles.

The measured >100 MeV $\\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven\nhours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies\nexceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the\nphenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to\nthis eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration\nunlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production\nthreshold to account for the observed $\\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the\nCME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary\ntype-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically\ndetected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not\nextend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end\ntime. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very\nweak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically\nwell-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME\nresulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the\noccurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray\nemission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into\nthe solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle\ntrapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by\nthe observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source\nregion persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF."}

With uniform background light, we\nanalyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the\ncluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we\nfind a local RM enhancement by $\\sim56\\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec\nscales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines.\nBehind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM\nmagnitude by $\\sim23.3\\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of\nrandomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We\nfind that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing\ncold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane\nof the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer\ncoefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more\ndepolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as\nbackground intensity decreases.

Because it is\nchemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that\nstudied molecular evolution.

We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of\nformaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO)\nhydrogenation on different cold surfaces.

Additionally, we\nused a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine\nwhere Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface\nsignificantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the\nco-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production\nat 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At\n10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%,\nand it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K.

The measured >100 MeV $\\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven\nhours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies\nexceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the\nphenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to\nthis eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration\nunlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production\nthreshold to account for the observed $\\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the\nCME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary\ntype-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically\ndetected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not\nextend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end\ntime. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very\nweak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically\nwell-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME\nresulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the\noccurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray\nemission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into\nthe solar surface.

(2025a, 2025b), located on\n  ADS at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...992..134P/abstract and\n  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250903767P/abstract", "summary": "The properties of stars and planets are shaped by the initial conditions of\ntheir natal clouds. However, the spatial scales over which the initial\nconditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We\nreport the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar\nmagnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass\nstar forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical\ndensity-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial\ndependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The\n$i_{\\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with\nthe typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a\nconnection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from\nthe Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system\nconfigurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\\rm mag}$ distribution\nand suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar\ncores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant\nimplications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should\nexplore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection."}

We show that at these stages, the full\nspectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is\nwell described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which\npowers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three three epochs per source\nwith a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can\nbe reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass\n($M_{\\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\\bullet}$ values, which in this\nsample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic\nscaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\\% credible interval $\n< \\pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations\n(e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \\propto T_p^4 \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-1}$),\nTDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{2/3}$ and\n$R_{out}/r_g \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy\ncorrelations ($M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\star}$ and $M_{\\bullet}$-$\\sigma_{\\star}$)\nnaturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently\nextended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\\bullet} < 10^{5}$) regime. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also\nreview and discuss different methods for $M_{\\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and\nfind that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical\nemission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black\nhole-host galaxy scalings."}
