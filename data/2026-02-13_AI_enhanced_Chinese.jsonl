Special Issue on Solar Atmospheric Abundances in Space and Time", "summary": "Solar atmospheric elemental abundances are now known to vary both in space and time. Dynamic modeling of these changes is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy of radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Recent studies have shown that including spatio-temporal variations in coronal abundances during solar flares leads to the formation of coronal condensations (rain), which are otherwise difficult to create in impulsively heated field aligned hydrodynamic flare models. These simulations start with a solar corona dominated by the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, and evaporate photospheric material into the post-flare loops. We here explore perhaps the most extreme non-solar starting condition for the coronal composition in these simulations: an initial corona dominated by the inverse FIP (iFIP) effect, such as is observed on active M-dwarf stars. We show that a flaring event in a corona enriched with high FIP elements leads to a solution similar to the solar case. Coronal rain is harder to form by this method during flares on M-dwarfs, however, if the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u5927\u6c14\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u9006FIP\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u65e5\u5195\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u65e5\u5195\u51dd\u7ed3\uff08\u96e8\uff09\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u592a\u9633\u5927\u6c14\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f90\u5c04\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u975e\u592a\u9633\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982M\u77ee\u661f\uff09\u7684\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u65e5\u5195\u51dd\u7ed3\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u9006FIP\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u65e5\u5195\u6761\u4ef6\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9006FIP\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\uff0c\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ecd\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u592a\u9633\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u51dd\u7ed3\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u4f4eFIP\u5143\u7d20\u8d2b\u4e4f\uff0c\u5219M\u77ee\u661f\u4e0a\u7684\u8000\u6591\u66f4\u96be\u5f62\u6210\u65e5\u5195\u51dd\u7ed3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u65e5\u5195\u51dd\u7ed3\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728M\u77ee\u661f\u7b49\u975e\u592a\u9633\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f4eFIP\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8d2b\u4e4f\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u51dd\u7ed3\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from X.Zeng et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters.

From these 3D maps, we reconstruct the 3D mass distributions of the ejecta in CO and SiO molecules, which we compare with those obtained by state-of-the-art, long-time hydrodynamical supernova explosion models computed with the Prometheus-HotB code for 10 different progenitors, including both red and blue supergiants. The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick.

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Warm Jupiters-giant exoplanets with orbital periods between 10 and 200 days-exhibit a broad range of eccentricities and are often accompanied by nearby low-mass planets. Understanding the origins of their orbital architectures requires examining both their migration histories and subsequent dynamical interactions. In this study, we perform extensive N-body simulations to explore how distant giant planet perturbers affect the eccentricity evolution of warm Jupiters and the role of nearby super-Earth companions in mediating these interactions. We find that while distant perturbers can induce large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations in warm Jupiters via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, the presence of nearby super-Earth companions often suppresses these variations via strong dynamical coupling. This mechanism naturally leads to a bimodal eccentricity distribution: warm Jupiters with nearby companions tend to maintain low eccentricities, whereas those without exhibit significantly broader eccentricity distributions. We show that reproducing the observed eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters lacking nearby companions is most naturally explained if a substantial fraction of distant perturbers occupy dynamically extreme orbits, either with large mutual inclinations or high orbital eccentricities. These results support a scenario in which warm Jupiters experience substantial post-disk dynamical evolution, shaped jointly by distant perturbers and nearby companions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9065\u8fdc\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u5bf9\u6696\u6728\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90bb\u8fd1\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6696\u6728\u661f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53cc\u5cf0\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6696\u6728\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4f34\u6709\u90bb\u8fd1\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8f68\u9053\u6784\u578b\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u91cfN\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9065\u8fdc\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u5bf9\u6696\u6728\u661f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u9065\u8fdc\u884c\u661f\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u53d1\u5927\u5e45\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4f46\u90bb\u8fd1\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8026\u5408\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53cc\u5cf0\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6696\u6728\u661f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7ecf\u5386\u663e\u8457\u7684\u76d8\u540e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d7\u9065\u8fdc\u6270\u52a8\u4f53\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u4f34\u661f\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020\u3002"}}

Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies -- to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$\u03c3$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$\u03c3$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d85\u65b0\u661f(SN)\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u7c7b\u4f3c\u661f\u7cfb(\u7eff\u8c4c\u8c46\u548c\u84dd\u8393\u661f\u7cfb)\u4e2d\u7684SN\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SN\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u6027\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aSN\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u6027\u6c14\u4f53\u901a\u9053\u88ab\u6e05\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf91242\u4e2a\u84dd\u8393(BB)\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0e\u77ac\u53d8\u53d1\u73b0\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa11\u4e2aSN\u4e8b\u4ef6(\u5176\u4e2d10\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29SN)\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SN\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0e\u666e\u901aBB\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "SN\u5bbf\u4e3bBB\u661f\u7cfb\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u8fd150Myr\u5185\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u6027\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u7d2b\u5916\u659c\u7387\u66f4\u84dd\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "SN\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7535\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u964d\u4f4e\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are old neutron stars spun up by accretion from a low-mass companion. These objects can switch between two emission regimes: rotation-powered radio pulsar and accreting X-ray pulsar. The origin of their optical and X-ray pulsations is still debated, although one model attributes them to synchrotron emission produced in a shock between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow. The small phase lag observed between optical and X-ray pulses in PSR J1023+0038 supports a common origin. We present a new measurement of the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulse profiles of PSR J1023+0038 and investigate the evolution of the time of passage at the ascending node ($T_{\\rm{asc}}$) up to 2023. We performed a timing analysis of optical observations obtained with Aqueye+ between 2021 and 2023 and of X-ray data from NICER in 2023. We derive updated values of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ and measure the optical - X-ray phase lag from simultaneous observations. We find that $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ increases by about 20 s per year. In January 2023, we measure a phase lag of $0.067 \\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $112.3 \\pm 30.7\\,\u03bc$s. Since 2017, the evolution of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ follows a parabolic trend, indicating an increase in the orbital period and orbital separation of the system. This behaviour is consistent with non-conservative Roche-lobe overflow, with the donor losing mass at a rate much higher than the accretion rate. The phase lag measurement further supports a common origin of the optical and X-ray pulsations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fc7\u6e21\u578b\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661fPSR J1023+0038\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u7684\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\u5171\u540c\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u6e21\u578b\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff08tMSPs\uff09\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u5b58\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75282021\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u7684Aqueye+\u5149\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c2023\u5e74\u7684NICER X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5149\u5b66-X\u5c04\u7ebf\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\uff08$T_{\\rm{asc}}$\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "$T_{\\rm{asc}}$\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u52a0\u7ea620\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u4e3a$0.067 \\pm 0.018$\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94$112.3 \\pm 30.7\\,\u03bc$s\uff09\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u7b26\u5408\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u6d1b\u5e0c\u74e3\u6ea2\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u652f\u6301\u5149\u5b66\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u660e\u4f34\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u3002"}}

Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\\sim 1500\\: {\\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis. The high-resolution and low-noise maps produced here provide an important cosmological tool for future studies, including measurements of the Compton-$y$ map power spectrum, cross-correlations with other tracers of the large-scale structure, detailed modeling of cluster pressure profiles, and study of the thermodynamic state of the baryons in the Universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528SPT-3G\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548cPlanck\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u70edSunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Compton-$y$\u53c2\u6570\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6291\u5236\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u7684tSZ Compton-$y$\u53c2\u6570\u56fe\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u538b\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u91cd\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff08LC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408SPT-3G\u548cPlanck\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684$y$\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u3001CMB\u6263\u9664\u3001CIB\u6263\u9664\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u3001\u4e92\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u548c\u5806\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c$y$\u56fe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u7684tSZ Compton-$y$\u53c2\u6570\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u793a\u8e2a\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e5\u5195\u73af\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u8870\u51cf\u626d\u6298\u632f\u8361\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982KHI\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548cEUV\u56fe\u50cf\u524d\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6e4d\u6d41\u963b\u5c3c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u7531\u4e8e\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u5173\u4e8eKHI\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5bf9\u65e5\u5195\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6e4d\u6d41\u963b\u5c3c\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548cEUV\u56fe\u50cf\u524d\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u632f\u8361\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\u53ca\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u6001\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u62df\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u632f\u8361\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6e4d\u6d41\u963b\u5c3c\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u62df\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u7531\u4e8e\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4d\u79fb\u51cf\u5c0f\u548c\u76f8\u79fb\u589e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u963b\u5c3c\u548cKHI\u9a71\u52a8\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u989d\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e5\u5195\u5730\u9707\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

The hierarchical clustering method provides formal identification with 3,863 members, but this set also includes objects from the neighboring Koronis2 and Kuitaisi families, as well as interlopers originating from the much older Koronis family. By tracking the trajectories of cluster objects backward in time, we identified 2,161 asteroids whose orbits converged with that of their parent body (832) Karin at $5.72\\pm 0.09$ My ago ($95$\\% C.L.). This method of calculating the family's age is based on a novel convergence metric that is directly related to the velocities at which fragments were ejected from (832) Karin. We analyze the extent to which members $\\leq 1.5$ km in diameter had drifted in semimajor axis due to Yarkovsky thermal forces and find it reflects the tilt of their rotation poles away from the ecliptic, recording the influence of the YORP torque. Karin's size frequency distribution in the $\\simeq(0.8-3)$ km range follows a power-law with a cumulative slope index $-3.20\\pm 0.01$. Removing members of the Karin family from the original group, we examine the Koronis2 family, whose members are associated with (158) Koronis. We find it difficult for large members of the Koronis2 family to converge with the orbit of (158) Koronis within its previously estimated age of $7.6$ My.

Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \\pm 1.30) \\cdot 10^{12}\\, M_\\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios.

Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(\u03b1,\u03b3)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present.

Cosmological constraints are derived from a joint analysis of CMB distance priors, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Pantheon+, Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD), and $H(z)$ data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC). Using the linear growth of matter perturbations, we estimate the clustering parameter $S_8$ within IDE extensions of the flat $\u039b(t)$CDM framework. At the perturbative level, we consider interaction terms of the form $Q_{\\text{I}}=\\varepsilon a H\\bar\u03c1_{\u039b(t)}$ (Model I) and $Q_{\\text{II}}=\\varepsilon H\\bar\u03c1_{\u039b(t)}$ (Model II). From the combined dataset, we obtain the constraints $S_8 = 0.870 \\pm 0.026$ for Model I and $S_8 = 0.872 \\pm 0.026$ for Model II. Finally, we discuss the implications for the coupling parameter $\\varepsilon$, taking into account the semi-analytical approximations and observational data employed in this study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5e73\u5766$\u039b(t)$CDM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08Model I\u548cModel II\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86$S_8$\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570$\\varepsilon$\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u8bba\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e73\u5766$\u039b(t)$CDM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9879\uff08$Q_{\\text{I}}$\u548c$Q_{\\text{II}}$\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CMB\u3001BAO\u3001SNe Ia\u3001RSD\u548cCC\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Model I\u548cModel II\u7684$S_8$\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u522b\u4e3a$0.870 \\pm 0.026$\u548c$0.872 \\pm 0.026$\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570$\\varepsilon$\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Methods: We first selected the data on the basis of a number of quality criteria and chose the best photometric data and the best parallaxes available in Gaia for Milky Way classical Cepheids. Secondly, we compiled an extensive list of period-radius (PR) relations available in the literature, and we also provide a new PR relation based on interferometric data in our previous work. Thirdly, combining the radius of classical Cepheids with distance estimates (based on Gaia parallaxes for the Milky Way and on eclipsing binaries for the Magellanic Clouds), we derived the surface brightness and colour of about 1700 classical Cepheids. Results: We first derived a new PR relation based on interferometric data and distances from the literature of seven classical Cepheids: $\\mathrm{\\log(R/R_{\\odot}) = 1.133_{\\pm 0.019} + 0.688_{\\pm 0.016} log(P)}$. The metallicity does not affect the PR relations. Secondly, we calculated three different SBCRs for the Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud classical Cepheids based on this new PR relation that clearly show the dependence of the metallicity on the SBCR based on Gaia magnitudes alone. Finally, we derived relations between the slopes, the zero points (ZP), and the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of these three SBCRs: $\\mathrm{Slope_{SBCR}=-0.0663_{\\pm 0.0121} [Fe/H] - 0.3010_{\\pm 0.0030}}$ and $\\mathrm{ZP_{SBCR}=-0.1016_{\\pm 0.0091} [Fe/H] + 3.9988_{\\pm 0.0029}}$.

The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \\times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\\mathrm{s} \\leq \u03c4\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case.

To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\\%$.

The 2009 solution is based on an average polynomial correction for each IR quadrant and is found to be poorly constrained at high fluence levels (e-) approaching the saturation limit. Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant). Because the new solution tends to make sources brighter, we recalibrate the five HST flux standards used to compute the IR zeropoints and find a negligible impact (0.1-0.2%) on the published values by Calamida et al. (2024), smaller than the RMS dispersion (0.5%) in the observed to synthetic flux ratios for all five flux standards. The new NLINFILE 9au15283i lin.fits was delivered to CRDS in October 2025 and will be used to reprocess all WFC3/IR imaging and grism observations in the MAST archive.

However, single black holes can undergo ``stone skipping'', with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u8d85\u8f7b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b64\u5b50\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u4f1a\u56e0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6469\u64e6\u800c\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e2a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u201c\u6253\u6c34\u6f02\u201d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u534a\u5f84\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u5076\u6781\u6fc0\u53d1\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u8d85\u8f7b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b64\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f68\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u53d7\u8feb\u963b\u5c3c\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u7684\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u54cd\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5b64\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u5076\u6781\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u65cb\u8fd1\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u6700\u540e\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u8f7b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\\arcsec\\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.", "AI": {"tldr": "B335 protostar\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u89c2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u6ce2\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u51b0\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76B335\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u80cc\u666f\u661f\u7684\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\u7ed8\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u6d88\u5149\u548cH$_2$O\u51b0\u5438\u6536\u56fe\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6fc0\u6ce2\u524d\u7f18\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u81ea\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u51b0\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u6ce23E\u4e0e\u7206\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f3aCO\u3001H$_2$\u548c[Fe II]\u53d1\u5c04\uff1b\u9760\u8fd1\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u533a\u57df\u6d88\u5149\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51b0\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff1bCO\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u8fdc\u5904\u5438\u6536\u3002", "conclusion": "B335\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6fc0\u6ce2\u548c\u6c14\u4f53/\u51b0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

In this second paper, we investigate a model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of discs threaded by a large-scale poloidal-net-flux magnetic field. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, the interface acts as a one-way barrier to inward transport of large-scale magnetic flux from the dead zone. This leads to magnetic flux depletion throughout most of the active zone, whereby it either advects inwards to the inner numerical boundary or accumulates just inside the interface. Second, two sources of strong variability emerge from the interface due to the difficulty of maintaining a constant, vertically integrated electrical current across distinct and evolving magnetic-field states. Third, despite the weak magnetothermal wind in the dead zone, a pressure maximum forms at the interface, leading to Rossby-wave-induced vortices. Fourth, unlike the model of Iwasaki et. al (2024), there is no 'transition zone' devoid of magnetic flux and magnetic winds. Instead, multiple outflow zones span all disc radii reflecting the radially varying launch conditions, with an inner turbulent wind impinging upon an outer, more laminar one. Fifth, a heated corona prevents the 'puffing up' of poloidal-net-flux, active disc regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5185\u533a\u7684\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6d3b\u533a\u4e0e\u6b7b\u533a\u4ea4\u754c\u5904\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u8f93\u8fd0\u3001\u754c\u9762\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6da1\u65cb\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u98ce\u533a\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5185\u533a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5b9c\u5c45\u5e26\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d3b\u533a\u4e0e\u6b7b\u533a\u4ea4\u754c\u5904\u7684\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u7ec4\u4e09\u7ef4\u5168\u5c40\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6b27\u59c6\u7535\u963b\u548c\u53cc\u6781\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u51b7\u76d8\u548c\u70ed\u5195\uff09\u3002", "result": "1. \u754c\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u5355\u5411\u5c4f\u969c\uff1b2. \u754c\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff1b3. \u754c\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u538b\u529b\u6700\u5927\u503c\u548c\u7f57\u65af\u6bd4\u6ce2\u6da1\u65cb\uff1b4. \u65e0\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7a7a\u7f3a\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u533a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u98ce\u533a\uff1b5. \u70ed\u5195\u6291\u5236\u6781\u5411\u51c0\u78c1\u901a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d3b\u533a\u4e0e\u6b7b\u533a\u754c\u9762\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u73af\u5883\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eIwasaki\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv < -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z < 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function.

Such a background signal could be produced by supermassive binary black holes, early-Universe processes such as inflation and phase transitions, or a mixture of both. One way to disentangle different contributions to the GWB is to search for anisotropic signatures. In this work, we search for anisotropy in the GWB using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Our analysis employs both the radiometer method and the spherical harmonic basis to characterize the distribution of GWB power across the sky. We calculate the angular power in the lowest five frequency bins and compare it with detection thresholds determined under the null hypothesis of isotropy. In the 5.26 nHz frequency bin, we identify a hotspot in the reconstructed sky map with a $p$-value of $0.016$ (the lowest in our analysis), which we attribute to noise fluctuations. While our search reveals no statistically significant anisotropy, we expect that the precise measurement of angular power spectrum of the GWB will become instrumental in determining the origin of the nanohertz GWB signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Parkes Pulsar Timing Array\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u591a\u4e2a\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u9635\u5217\u5408\u4f5c\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6216\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u6790\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Parkes Pulsar Timing Array\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f90\u5c04\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7403\u8c10\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u80fd\u91cf\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f4e\u4e94\u4e2a\u9891\u7387\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u89d2\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5e76\u4e0e\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u57285.26\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u7387\u533a\u95f4\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u70b9\uff08p\u503c\u4e3a0.016\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cfGWB\u7684\u89d2\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002"}}

Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77ee\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u7cfb\uff08dSph\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u77ee\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ef4\u91cc\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6052\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002"}}

A primordial interpretation based on differences in bulk densities -- where rocky and water-rich planets form via migration pathways -- offers an alternative to atmospheric loss scenarios. Updated interior structure models of water worlds with adiabatic steam atmospheres reproduce the observed valley near $\\sim2~R_\\oplus$ more accurately. Furthermore, migration models from our Genesis library suggest that these formation pathways can also account for the distinct period distributions of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, as well as the emergence of the hot Neptune desert. Motivated by this, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for close-in Kepler planets ($P<100$ days), combining rocky planets and water worlds without H/He envelopes. The inferred mass distributions of rocky and water-rich planets peak at $\\sim2.6~M_\\oplus$ and $\\sim7~M_\\oplus$, respectively, with the water mass fraction of water worlds peaking at $\\sim41\\%$. Water worlds provide a good representation of the Kepler sub-Neptune population, with the radius cliff emerging as a ``waterfall\" -- a sharp decline in their occurrence.

In this study, we investigate the origin of the large X-ray variability of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 using two \\xmm{} observations, which are at least 65 ksec long and have a 0.3-10 keV X-ray flux difference by a factor of $\\sim$2.5. We extracted mean spectra, Fourier-frequency resolved covariance, and time-lag spectra and performed modelling of all spectra in a self-consistent manner.

However, during high flux, the variabilities are dominated by the reflection components most of the time.

Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region.

We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\u03c3\\sqrt{2\\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\u03c3$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \\lesssim \u03c3$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u6f02\u6d6e\u884c\u661f\u548c\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u6052\u661f\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u504f\u79bb\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5747\u5206\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f88\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\u4f1a\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7ecf\u5386\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5176\u6bcd\u661f\u548c\u629b\u5c04\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u7531\u6f02\u6d6e\u884c\u661f\u548c\u661f\u9645\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u901f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ca\u4f4e\u901f\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a$\u03c3\u221a{2ln(m/m_p)}$\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u80fd\u91cf\u5747\u5206\uff1b\u4f4e\u901f\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\u4f1a\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u901f\u5ea6\u7ffb\u500d\uff1b\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5176\u6bcd\u661f\u548c\u629b\u5c04\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5e74\u9f84\u3002"}}

A slightly modified abstract is presented here due to the arXiv limit", "summary": "Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7<z<2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $< 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528MUSE\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf947\u4e2a0.7<z<2.0\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MgII\u53d1\u5c04\u6655\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5916\u6d41\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MgII\u5916\u6d41\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u661f\u65cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u98ce\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9MgII\u53d1\u5c04\u6655\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5929\u4f53\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6837\u672c\u89c2\u6d4b\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9bMgII\u6655\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5916\u6d41\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMUSE\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf947\u4e2a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5f84\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u58f3\u5c42\uff09\u62df\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u7684MgII\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5916\u6d41\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5f00\u89d2\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7b49\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "MgII\u5916\u6d41\u901f\u5ea6\u968f\u534a\u5f84\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5185\u533a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u8d8b\u52bf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5f00\u89d2\u5916\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u5f00\u89d2\u8303\u56f4\u66f4\u5e7f\u3002MgII\u6655\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u503c\u5728\u534a\u5149\u534a\u5f845 kpc\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe20 kpc\u3002", "conclusion": "MgII\u6655\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u652f\u6301\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u9a71\u52a8\u98ce\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7d27\u51d1\u6655\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6655\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8868\u660eMgII\u6655\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $>2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $\u03b1$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\\mathcal{M} < M_\\odot$ to those with $\\mathcal{M} \\geqslant M_\\odot$ increases with $\u03b1$.

Capistrano", "\u00d6zg\u00fcr Akarsu"], "title": "Probing Dynamical Dark Energy with Late-Time Data: Evidence, Tensions, and the Limits of the $w_0w_a$CDM Framework", "comment": "18 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "We test the dynamical dark-energy $w_0w_a$CDM (CPL) framework against $\u039b$CDM using CMB anisotropies and lensing together with late-time distance probes: DESI DR2 BAO, the completed SDSS-IV BAO consensus compilation, a transverse/angular BAO compilation (BAOtr), and the Cepheid-calibrated PantheonPlus SN~Ia likelihood (PP\\&SH0ES). We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,\u03a9_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $\u039b$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08CPL\uff09\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5fae\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff08CMB\uff09\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u900f\u955c\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u665a\u671f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CPL\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u665a\u671f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08CPL\uff09\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u5408CMB\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u900f\u955c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u665a\u671f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982DESI DR2 BAO\u3001SDSS-IV BAO\u3001BAOtr\u548cPantheonPlus SN~Ia\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCPL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8bba\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\uff08\u5982CMB+PP&SH0ES+BAOtr\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5219\u66f4\u652f\u6301\u039bCDM\u3002\u4e0d\u540cBAO\u6570\u636e\u5bf9CPL\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u5386\u53f2\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51faCPL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u665a\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5f53\u524dBAO\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

These fibrils are identified from the 1.3~mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\\sim900$ AU for a source at $\\sim$3 kpc, using the \\textit{FilFinder} software. Using \\textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \\textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \\textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \\textit{APEX}) surveys.

A thermophysical model together with a radiative transfer model suggest a thermal inertia of 13$\\pm$10 [J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.5}$], an equivalent emissivity of 0.8$\\pm$0.1, a loss tangent of 0.4$\\pm$0.3, and an index of refraction 1.8$\\pm$0.3. Based on previous laboratory measurements, the modeled index of refraction suggests a regolith porosity of about 45%. However, thermal inertia models using the material parameters of ordinary chondrite indicate a grain size of 10s $\u03bc$m and require a high porosity of $\\sim$90% to explain the low thermal inertia. In order to explain such a contradiction, we postulate that some repulsive mechanism might be in effect to reduce the contact of grains and therefore the thermal inertia. The loss tangent of Juno's regolith corrected for the modeled thermal skin depth is in the order of 0.5, much higher than that of the lunar regolith and indicating an electrical skin depth of L = 0.1 - 1.4 mm that is within the thermal skin depth. The shape of the rotational lightcurve of Juno in the mm wavelengths is dominated by its irregular shape, but rotational variations in the thermal and/or dielectric properties cannot be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that mm-wavelength observations of asteroids provide an extra dimension of constraints to the porosity and grain size of asteroid regolith compared to the thermal infrared observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7ALMA\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c0f\u884c\u661fJuno\u57281.3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u70ed\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u70ed\u60ef\u6027\u3001\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u635f\u8017\u89d2\u6b63\u5207\u53ca\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a45%\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u7403\u7c92\u9668\u77f3\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u6392\u65a5\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08ALMA\uff09\u548c\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u884c\u661fJuno\u7684\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7535\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array\uff08ALMA\uff09\u6d4b\u91cfJuno\u57281.3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u70ed\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53cd\u6f14\u5176\u70ed\u60ef\u6027\u3001\u7b49\u6548\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u635f\u8017\u89d2\u6b63\u5207\u53ca\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aJuno\u7684\u70ed\u60ef\u6027\u4e3a13\u00b110 [J m^-2 K^-1 s^-0.5]\uff0c\u7b49\u6548\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u4e3a0.8\u00b10.1\uff0c\u635f\u8017\u89d2\u6b63\u5207\u4e3a0.4\u00b10.3\uff0c\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u4e3a1.8\u00b10.3\u3002\u5176\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a45%\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u7403\u7c92\u9668\u77f3\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0810\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u5b54\u9699\u7387\uff08~90%\uff09\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u635f\u8017\u89d2\u6b63\u5207\u503c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7535\u5b66\u8d8b\u80a4\u6df1\u5ea6\u57280.1-1.4\u6beb\u7c73\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6392\u65a5\u673a\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u9897\u7c92\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

We consider three types of connection procedures to treat the discontinuity in a nonunified equation of state around the crust-core transition: (1) the direct connection procedure, (2) the crossover connection procedure, and (3) the segmented method. Our results indicate that the mass-radius relations of neutron stars are almost unaffected by the details of the connection procedure. However, the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars are sensitive to the crust-core connection procedures. The tidal deformability is closely related to gravitational-wave measurements. For a canonical 1.4$M_\\odot$ neutron star, uncertainties in the tidal deformability $\u039b_{1.4}$ from different connection procedures can exceed 20\\%.

Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \\equiv \u03c3_8 (\u03a9_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \\pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity. The result is consistent with Planck and recent cluster-based measurements. The inferred temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations within uncertainties, whereas the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a slope steeper than the self-similar prediction. From the resulting posterior distribution of the forward model, we derive lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities.

Periodic variations, such as due to the solar diurnal modulation, the 27-day solar rotation, the 11-year solar cycle, and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle have also been characterized.

We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary.

Fractionation during atmospheric loss can preferentially remove lighter elements such as hydrogen, while retaining heavier species like oxygen. In this study, we investigate how and under what conditions hydrodynamic escape and chemical fractionation jointly shape the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, especially for mixed H2 + H2O atmospheres. We develop BOREAS, a self-consistent mass loss model coupling a 1D Parker wind formulation with a mass-dependent fractionation scheme, which we apply across a range of planet masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and incident XUV fluxes, allowing us to track hydrogen and oxygen escape rates at different snapshots in time. We find that oxygen is efficiently retained over most of the parameter space. Significant oxygen loss occurs under high incident XUV fluxes, while at intermediate fluxes oxygen loss is largely confined to low-gravity planets. Where oxygen is retained, irradiation is too weak to drive significant escape of hydrogen and thus limiting atmospheric enrichment. By contrast, our model predicts that sub-Neptunes undergo substantial atmospheric enrichment over approx. 200 Myr when hydrogen escape is efficient and accompanied by partial oxygen entrainment. Notably, our results imply that sub-Neptunes near the radius valley can evolve into water-rich planets, in agreement with GJ 9827 d. Present-day water-rich atmospheres may have originated from water-poor envelopes under some conditions, highlighting the need to include chemical fractionation in evolution models.

We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85<\\log_{10}(M_*/M_\\odot)<11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies.

We address this issue through flux-resolved, broadband (0.8-20 keV) spectral modelling and simultaneous covariance spectral analysis during two $\u03ba$ and two $\u03c9$ class observations using \\textit{AstroSat}/SXT and LAXPC. The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally. The combined results suggest that radiation-pressure-driven structural changes in the disc, with a slower coronal response, produce the observed oscillations, consistent with cyclic disc evacuation and refilling in the $\u03ba$ and $\u03c9$ classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86GRS~1915+105\u5fae\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u4e2d\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027X\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bbd\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u632f\u8361\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u4e14\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u5195\u533a\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3GRS~1915+105\u5fae\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u4e2d\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027X\u5c04\u7ebf\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u03ba\u548c\u03c9\uff09\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5149\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86AstroSat/SXT\u548cLAXPC\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u91cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\uff080.8-20 keV\uff09\u5149\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u533a\u95f4\u7531\u70ed\u4e14\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u548c\u9661\u7684\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f4e\u901a\u91cf\u533a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u8f83\u51b7\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u9000\u7f29\u7684\u76d8\u548c\u66f4\u786c\u7684\u5195\u533a\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u3002\u5feb\u901f\u76f8\u5e72\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\uff0c\u800c\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u6210\u5206\u8d21\u732e\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u632f\u8361\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u5195\u533a\u54cd\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u4e0e\u03ba\u548c\u03c9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7684\u62bd\u7a7a\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u586b\u5145\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Multi-probe analyses that incorporate complementary tracers of the gas distribution around haloes offer a pathway to calibrate these effects and recover unbiased cosmological information. In this work, we forecast the constraining power of a joint analysis combining fiducial data from a Stage-IV WL survey with measurements of the dispersion measure from fast radio bursts (FRBs). We evaluate the ability of this approach to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the astrophysical processes governing baryonic feedback, and we quantify the impact of key FRB systematics, including redshift uncertainties and source clustering. We find that, even after accounting for these effects, a 3$\\times$2-point analysis of WL and FRBs significantly improves cosmological constraints, reducing the degradation factor on $S_8$ by $\\sim 80\\%$ compared to WL alone. We further show that FRBs alone are sensitive only to a degenerate combination of the key baryonic parameters, $\\log_{10} M_{\\rm c}$ and $\u03b7_{\\rm b}$, and that the inclusion of WL measurements breaks this degeneracy. Finally, we extend our framework to incorporate galaxy clustering measurements using Luminous Red Galaxy and Emission Line Galaxy samples, performing a unified 6$\\times$2-point analysis of WL, dispersion measures of FRBs, and galaxy clustering. While this combined approach tightens constraints on $\u03a9_{\\rm m}$ and $\\log_{10} M_{\\rm c}$, it does not lead to a significant improvement in $S_8$ constraints beyond those obtained from WL and FRBs alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\uff08WL\uff09\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\uff08FRBs\uff09\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9$S_8$\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cd\u5b50\u53cd\u9988\u53c2\u6570\u7b80\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5165\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u76846\u00d72\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86WL\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff08WL+FRBs+\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u91cd\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u65e0\u504f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "1.\u7ed3\u5408Stage-IVWL\u6570\u636e\u548cFRBs\u5f25\u6563\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c3\u00d72\u70b9\u5206\u6790\uff1b2.\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u91cd\u5b50\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3.\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a6\u00d72\u70b9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "1.WL+FRBs\u5206\u6790\u4f7f$S_8$\u7684\u9000\u5316\u56e0\u5b50\u51cf\u5c11~80%\uff1b2.FRBs\u5355\u72ec\u5bf9\u91cd\u5b50\u53c2\u6570$\\log_{10}M_{\\rmc}$\u548c$\u03b7_{\\rmb}$\u5b58\u5728\u7b80\u5e76\uff0cWL\u53ef\u6253\u7834\uff1b3.\u52a0\u5165\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u4ec5\u5bf9$\u03a9_{\\rmm}$\u548c$\\log_{10}M_{\\rmc}$\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "WL+FRBs\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing.

The scintillation parameters--decorrelation bandwidth $\u0394\u03bd_{\\rm d}$, decorrelation time $\u0394\u03c4_{\\rm d}$, and drift rate $dt/d\u03bd$--are fully characterized. Our measured $\u0394\u03c4_{\\rm d}$ implies $\u0394\u03c4_{\\rm d} < 4$~s at 575-725~MHz under a Kolmogorov spectrum, which is shorter than the magnetar's 5.54~s spin period. This result naturally explains the previously reported absence of pulse-to-pulse coherence at these frequencies. Kinematic modeling locates the dominant scattering screen at $1.6\\pm0.1$~kpc away from the Earth, within the Sagittarius Arm. The screen coincides with the HII region JCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932 and is unrelated to the magnetar's 2018 outburst suggested by earlier studies. A scintillation arc detected at 14.0~GHz represents the highest-frequency arc observed to date. The asymmetry of arcs is linearly correlated with a dispersion-measure gradient across the screen ($r = 0.959$, $p < 10^{-8}$). We also measure its refractive scintillation timescale, which is only $1.21\\pm0.19$~d. Clear DISS at 14~GHz effectively resolves the debate over a possible strong-to-weak scattering transition at this frequency. These results extend the ISS characterization of magnetars to previously unexplored frequencies and provide a precise probe of the ionized interstellar medium in the Sagittarius Arm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9XTE~J1810$-$197\u78c1\u661f\u516d\u5e74\u7684\u591a\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u661f\u9645\u95ea\u70c1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4f4e\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86\u6563\u5c04\u5c4f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e8614 GHz\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u78c1\u661f\u661f\u9645\u95ea\u70c1\uff08ISS\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ea\u70c1\u73b0\u8c61\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eba\u9a6c\u81c2\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u6d77\u5929\u9a6c\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08TMRT\uff09\u57287.0\u30018.6\u548c14.0 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e3a\u671f\u516d\u5e74\u7684\u591a\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u95ea\u70c1\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6563\u5c04\u5c4f\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u5730\u74031.6\u00b10.1 kpc\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u9a6c\u81c2\u4e2d\u7684HII\u533a\u57dfJCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932\u91cd\u5408\u300214 GHz\u4e0b\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u5f27\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u95ea\u70c1\u5f27\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u6563\u5c04\u5c4f\u4e0a\u7684\u8272\u6563\u503c\u68af\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c14 GHz\u4e0b\u6e05\u6670\u7684DISS\u73b0\u8c61\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5f3a\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u78c1\u661fISS\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u79bb\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e8614 GHz\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6b64\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8be5\u9891\u6bb5\u6563\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002"}}

Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u66b4\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u989d\u5916\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u521d\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u8d85\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u4e0e\u8f7b\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7559\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u661f\u7cfb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u66b4\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u989d\u5916\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u521d\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u573a\u5bf9\u66b4\u80c0\u5b50\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u66b4\u80c0\u5b50\u4e0e\u989d\u5916\u573a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u632f\u8361\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u53d1\u73b0\u632f\u8361\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u632f\u8361\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5de1\u5929\u4e2d\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\uff08BOSS DR12\uff09\u867d\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u8026\u5408\u66b4\u80c0\u5b50\u548c\u989d\u5916\u573a\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5de1\u5929\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone.

Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\\rm obs}$/L$_{\\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more \"preventive\" than \"ejective\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08$z<$ 0.2\uff09\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dAGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6dec\u706d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PSBs\u867dAGN\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176AGN\u5149\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660eAGN\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u6dec\u706d\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u4e3a\u6e29\u548c\uff0c\u504f\u5411\u9884\u9632\u800c\u975e\u5267\u70c8\u9a71\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6dec\u706d\uff0cAGN\u53cd\u9988\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd1\u90bb\u6dec\u706d\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9AGN\u53cd\u9988\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u8ba8AGN\u5728PSBs\u3001SFGs\u548cQGs\u4e2d\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6dec\u706d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86eROSITA/eFEDS\uff08X\u5c04\u7ebf\uff09\u3001WISE\uff08\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\uff09\u548cFIRST\uff08\u5c04\u7535\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86$z<$ 0.2\u7684PSBs\u3001SFGs\u548cQGs\u4e2d\u7684AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30AGN\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5e94\u7528\u53e0\u52a0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5e73\u5747AGN\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u89c2\u6d4b\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u9884\u671f\u5149\u5ea6\uff08L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86AGN\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "PSBs\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002PSBs\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916AGN\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u662fSFGs\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176AGN\u5149\u5ea6\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6MIR AGN\u3002PSBs\u7684\u6574\u4f53AGN\u8f90\u5c04\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ea2\u79fb\u5339\u914d\u7684SFGs\u548cQGs\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0d\u80fd\u6392\u9664PSBs\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u5ea6\u6216\u906e\u63a9AGN\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9bAGN\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u6b8b\u4f59\u6c14\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6dec\u706d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fbAGN\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6dec\u706d\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u4e3a\u6e29\u548c\uff0c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u201c\u9884\u9632\u6027\u201d\u800c\u975e\u201c\u9a71\u79bb\u6027\u201d\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740AGN\u5e76\u672a\u901a\u8fc7\u5267\u70c8\u9a71\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u6dec\u706d\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\u6291\u5236\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($\u03be\\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($\u03be=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($\u03be=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_\u03b8$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($\u03be<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_\u03b8$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog.

These images are fundamentally related to properties of the luminous accretion disks, since black holes themselves produce no light. We develop a simple prescription to relate observational features of black hole images to a toy model for the intensity profile of the associated accretion disk. We apply our model to the original EHT image of M87*, as well as to the reanalyzed image from the PRIMO algorithm, providing generic, simultaneous constraints on the mass of the black hole and properties of the accretion disk emission. While current images lack the resolution to confidently detect the photon ring, the consideration of multiple image parameters are found to contain enough information to provide constraints on the inner edge of the accretion disk along with the black hole mass. Using observed features of the original EHT image, we constrain the mass of M87* to be $6.6^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ to 68$\\%$ confidence, and find that emission may extend all the way to the black hole horizon.

Both analyses rule out an inner edge of the accretion disk coinciding with the innermost stable circular orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the narrow ring width reported in the PRIMO image also confidently rules out emission increasing all the way down to the black hole horizon. Further assumptions on the mass of M87* and connections between the accretion disk cutoff and physical radii allow for rudimentary black hole spin estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7EHT\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u5de8\u9ed1\u6d1eM87*\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5185\u7f18\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u4e86Schwarzschild\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528EHT\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eEHT\u5bf9M87*\u7684\u539f\u56fe\u50cf\u548cPRIMO\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51faM87*\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a$6.6\\pm1.2\\times10^9M_\\odot$\uff08\u539f\u59cbEHT\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u6216$6.4\\pm0.7\\times10^9M_\\odot$\uff08PRIMO\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5185\u7f18\u5728$3M$\u5230$5.3M$\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5185\u7f18\u4e0e\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u91cd\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $\u03be_{21,\u03bd}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $\u03be_{21,\u03bd}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\u03be_{21,\u03bd}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc721\u5398\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u6c14\u6ce1\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u65f6\u671f\uff08EoR\uff09\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u6c14\u6ce1\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed8\u5236\u6c14\u6ce1\u5206\u5e03\u56e0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u524d\u666f\u6c61\u67d3\u800c\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752821\u5398\u7c73\u7ebf\u4e0e\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173$\u03be_{21,\u03bd}$\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6ce1\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u6c14\u6ce1\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "$\u03be_{21,\u03bd}(r)$\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb$r$\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u9971\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u968fEoR\u8fdb\u5c55\u4ece\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u6ce1\u534a\u5f84$r$\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u4e30\u5ea6\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u65f6\u95f4/\u62d3\u6251\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u5316\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5085\u7acb\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, previous observations have shown a range of environments around them. The previous targets are limited to bright quasars ($M_{1450}\\lesssim-25$), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars ($-24<M_{1450}<-22$) at $z\\sim6.18$, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman $\u03b1$ emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity. One quasar (J0844$-$0132) resides in an overdense region ($\u03b4_\\mathrm{LAE}=3.77\\pm0.97$), whereas the other three fields are consistent with normal fields. The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes.

We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z>9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$\u03b1$ (Ly$\u03b1$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\\sim 10-100\\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08$z\\gtrsim 9$\uff09\u7d2b\u5916\u660e\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6c22\u539f\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\uff08HI\uff09\u805a\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5c18\u57c3\u906e\u853d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u6cb3\u5916\u661f\u7cfb\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u96be\u9898\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff08$z\\gtrsim 9$\uff09\u7d2b\u5916\u660e\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u6027\u6c22\uff08HI\uff09\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u518d\u7535\u79bb\u521d\u671f\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u6655\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRSpec Prism\u5bf9$z>9$\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u9759\u6b62\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u81f3\u5149\u5b66\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u963b\u5c3cLy$\u03b1$\u5438\u6536\uff08DLA\uff09\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfcHI\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\uff08SFR\uff09\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6548\u7387\u6781\u9ad8\uff08$\\sim 10-100\\,$Myr\u8017\u5c3d\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u672c\u5730\u5b87\u5b99\u7684Kennicutt-Schmidt\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cHI\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fd8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c-\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5c18\u57c3-\u6c14\u4f53\u6bd4\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u661f\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u661f\u7cfb\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u539f\u59cbHI\u6c14\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u4f4e\u5c18\u57c3\u906e\u853d\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b87\u5b99\u9ece\u660e\u65f6\u671f\u7d2b\u5916\u660e\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Optical outburst spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries enable studies of extreme accretion and ejection phenomena. While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than < 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u5149\u5b66\u7206\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u7fa4\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bbd\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5149\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7206\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u5df2\u88ab\u90e8\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bbd\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u666e\u904d\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u516d\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bbd\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5171\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bbd\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e0e\u5149\u5ea6\u5448\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6c22\u5df4\u5c14\u672b\u7cfb\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bbd\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u7206\u53d1\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u53d7\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u518d\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u906e\u853d\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}\\gtrsim0.2$) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{\\rm UV}>-15$) in the standard $\u039b$CDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm -- originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension -- which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities ($f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 0.05-0.1$, $M_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim -17$ to $-15$).

While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D hydro\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5728\u71c3\u70e7\u6269\u5f20\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\u5f15\u5165\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u71c3\u70e7\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7206\u8f70\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d3D\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u6269\u5f20\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528FLASH\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u71c3\u70e7\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u540e\uff0c\u71c3\u70e7\u6548\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u7403\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u672a\u71c3\u70e7\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u71c3\u70e7\u4e0e\u672a\u71c3\u70e7\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u71c3\u70e7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
