To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RxBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6db5\u76d614\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u65b9\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1150\u9053\u5355\u9009\u3001230\u9053\u591a\u9009\u548c879\u9053\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\u3002\u7531\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd518\u4e2aSOTA LLM\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\u3001Grok-4-0709\u548cDeepSeek-R1-0528\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u836f\u5e08\u3002\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9876\u7ea7\u901a\u7528LLM\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u519b\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u5a01\u836f\u5b66\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRxBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u7c7b\u522b\u548c14\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u9009\u3001\u591a\u9009\u3001\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u8d44\u6df1\u836f\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u3002\u5bf918\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "LLM\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\u660e\u663e\uff0cGemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\u3001Grok-4-0709\u548cDeepSeek-R1-0528\u4f4d\u5c45\u7b2c\u4e00\u68af\u961f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\u3002\u4e0e\u6301\u8bc1\u836f\u5e08\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9876\u7ea7LLM\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5339\u654c\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9876\u7ea7LLM\u3002", "conclusion": "RxBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u4e13\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLMs\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoherent Contextual Decoding (CCD)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b73.48x\u52a0\u901f\u53ca3.91%\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5373\u65f6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCCD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u65e9\u62d2\u7edd\u6b21\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe3.48x\u52a0\u901f\u548c3.91%\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "CCD\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.\n  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping.

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence.

Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models.

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1a\u6807\u7b7e\u654f\u611f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7f13\u89e3\u626d\u66f2\u3002\u57288\u5927\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e16\u4e2aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728BiasedMNIST\u4e0a\u6539\u558422.9%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u540c\u5f02\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u62c9\u8fd1\u540c\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdc\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u626d\u66f2\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10\u3001CIFAR100\u3001Caltech-101/256\u3001ImageNet\u3001BiasedMNIST\u3001UTKFace\u3001CelebA\u7b498\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e16\u4e2aSOTA\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728BiasedMNIST\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u635f\u5931\u6539\u558422.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Current MEE works mainly face two challenges: (1) Inadequate extraction framework modeling for handling complex and flexible multimedia event structure; (2) The absence of multimodal-aligned training data for effective knowledge transfer to MEE task. In this work, we propose a Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework (SSGPF) using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as backbone for adaptive structure capturing to solve MEE task. At the initial step of SSGPF, we design Event Type Schema Guided Prompting (ETSGP) for event detection, then we devise Argument Role Schema Guided Prompting (ARSGP) that contains multi-step prompts with text-bridged grounding technique for argument extraction. We construct a weakly-aligned multimodal event labeled dataset based on existing unimodal event annotations, then conduct parameter efficient instruction tuning with LoRA on LLaVA-v1.5-7B under SSGPF.

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\uff08DI\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1bPEFT\u867d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Whisper\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cdMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4ee5KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u4e9a\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cWhisper\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe73.25%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f2.1\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u53caPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations.

Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image.

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\uff08Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection\uff09\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OVD\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9MLLMs\u7406\u89e3\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u88c1\u526a+RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u8de8\u88c1\u526a\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u6270\u4e71\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u9002\u5b9c\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "1. \u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u83b7\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b2.

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K.

This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%.

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\\% of their energy consumption.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%.

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability.

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items.

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5982RoBERTa\u548cMistral\uff09\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7c89\u4e1d\u6570\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u70b9\u8d5e\uff09\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528EVONS\u548cFakeNewsNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u96be\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a(i)\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c(ii)\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EVONS\u548cFakeNewsNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff08RoBERTa\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4Mistral\uff09\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7c89\u4e1d\u6570\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u70b9\u8d5e\uff09\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\u3001Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u964d\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\uff08t-SNE\u548cPCA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u503c\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u201c\u75c5\u6bd2\u201d\u5212\u5206\u5b9e\u7528\u4f46\u4f4e\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u75c5\u6bd2\u6027\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u76ca\u4f46API\u9650\u5236\u96be\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002t-SNE\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ePCA\u7528\u4e8e\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3002Mistral\u5d4c\u5165\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5e03\u62c6\u5206\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u8005\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 grounding \u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5e38\u56e0\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u8bef\u8fdb\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd plateau \u6216\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u504f\u7f6e\u5e76\u8d8b\u5411\u4f4e\u71b5\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-Few\u6846\u67b6\uff1aChallenger\u91c7\u6837\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff1bSolver\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002\u6bcf\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 grounding \u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982Qwen3-8B-Base\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8f83R-Zero\u63d0\u5347+3.0\u5206\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u752820\u500d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684General-Reasoner\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u786e\u8ba4 grounded challenger \u548c curriculum solver \u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Few\u7f13\u89e3\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources.

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains.

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793aTransformer\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u9012\u5f52\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3OOD\u6df1\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u867d\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u62ec\u53f7\u5d4c\u5957\u6216\u903b\u8f91\u5b50\u53e5\uff09\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6e90\u4e8eTransformer\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u6808\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u591a\u5c42\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u201c\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u201d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\uff08locator\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5668\uff08replacer\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u6df1\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u5728\u66f4\u6df1\u9012\u5f52\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4e09\u9886\u57df\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6808\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u9012\u5f52\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations.

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMIGR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u800c\u975e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u53d7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8def\u5f84\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08MI\uff09\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u60c5\u611f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\uff1b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u7ec4\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728DFEW\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f34\u968f\u60c5\u611f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ece18.10%\u964d\u81f37.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u60c5\u611f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "code_url": "https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFac", "AI": {"tldr": "UniFact\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6865\u63a5LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3HD\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3FV\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u6574\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1bHD\u4e0eFV\u867d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u4f46\u5b64\u7acb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6865\u63a5\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UniFact\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ca\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0FV\u4e0eHD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8986\u76d6\u591aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6b67\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "1) \u65e0\u8303\u5f0f\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b2) HD\u4e0eFV\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff1b3) \u6574\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u65b9\u6cd5 consistently \u8fbeSOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9bHD\u4e0eFV\u5206\u6b67\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u7edf\u4e00\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies.

Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework.

However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's \"Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment\" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains.

We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLightHCG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8f7b\u91cf\u5377\u79efVAE-based\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1193~99%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eInceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG16\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "LightHCG\u91c7\u7528HSIC-based\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cGraph Autoencoder-based\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5377\u79efVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u771f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u4ec5\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u76841~7%\uff08\u51cf\u5c1193~99%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eInceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u3001VGG16\u3002", "conclusion": "LightHCG\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc75\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u30013\u4e2aLLM\u30013\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CoT\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7b49\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u6307\u68075-10%\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8d851000\u4e07\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u805a\u7126\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u9760\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d65\u8bed\u8a00\u30013 LLM\u30013\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8d851000\u4e07\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\u8003\u5bdf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982CoT\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u6307\u68075-10%\uff1b\u4f18\u5f02\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684 scalable \u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization.

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset.

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy.

We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day.

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoCoP\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u5b58\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d1e\u5bdf\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "MoCoP\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u5c42\u652f\u6301\uff1a(i)\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c(ii)\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c(iii)\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff1a\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173(rET=-0.81, p<0.001)\uff0c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fd1\u96f6\u76f8\u5173(rEL\u22480)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9053\u5fb7\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff1bMoCoP\u91cd\u6784\u4f26\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5185\u7701\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8fde\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u8ba1\u7b97\u9053\u5fb7\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses.

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models.

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency.

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWorldPack\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6253\u5305\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53bb\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u65f6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u671f\u672a\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f68\u8ff9\u6253\u5305\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u7ef4\u6301rollout\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9700\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e13\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684Minecraft\u57fa\u51c6LoopNav\u4e0a\uff0cWorldPack\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldPack\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks.

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60GMM\u70b9\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DeepGMR\uff09\u5728\u90e8\u5206-\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\uff08ARPS\uff09\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u516c\u5171\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8aTransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60GMM\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u70b9\u96c6\u5e73\u79fb\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206-\u90e8\u5206\u70b9\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fDeepGMR\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63ed\u793a\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\uff08ARPS\uff09\u5c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u70b9\u96c6\u7684\u516c\u5171\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230DeepGMR\u548cUGMMReg\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "ARPS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DeepGMR\u548cUGMMReg\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u6216Transformer\u63d0\u53d6\u91cd\u53e0\u533a/\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u7684\u5148\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eGMM\u70b9\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u90e8\u5206-\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u51c6\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain.

However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\uff08AC/AS\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u548c\u533a\u57df\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCoDeGraph\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u30013D\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4f53\u79ef\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cAC/AS\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6839\u690d\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Vision Transformer\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u89c1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bViT patch\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f29\u653e\uff08similarity scaling\uff09\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u70e7\u5c3d\uff08neighbor-burnout\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u30022. \u63d0\u51faCoDeGraph\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u30023. \u6269\u5c55\u81f33D MRI\uff1a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f53\u79ef\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u30024. \u7528CoDeGraph\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6865\u63a5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "CoDeGraph\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u97003D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672cAC/AS\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5168\u94fe\u8def\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672cAC/AS\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u523b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e0e\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks.

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task.

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u62fc\u63a5\u4ea7\u751f\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5171\u8bed\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5171\u8bed\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891-\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u68c0\u7d22\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u97f3\u9891-\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891-\u8fd0\u52a8\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u65e0\u7f1d\u62fc\u63a5\u68c0\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u8282\u70b9\u6bb5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5171\u8bed\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions.

We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model.

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation.

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones.

Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.\n  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK.

To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGeoViS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9 grounding \u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u63a2\u7d22\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9grounding\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u6b21\u6216\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "GeoViS\uff1a\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u5e8f\u5217\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9065\u611fgrounding\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGeoViS\u5728\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9grounding\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoViS\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9grounding\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training.

To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios.

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrackNetV5 \u901a\u8fc7 MDD \u6a21\u5757\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u5411\u5148\u9a8c\u548c R-STR \u5934\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u5728 TrackNetV2 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 F1 0.9859 \u7684\u65b0 SOTA\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0 3.7% FLOPs \u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "TrackNet V1-V3 \u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u906e\u6321\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0cV4 \u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u5dee\u5206\u4e22\u5f03\u6781\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u5411\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "TrackNetV5 \u96c6\u6210 MDD \u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e3a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u6781\u6027\u573a\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u548c R-STR \u5934\uff08Transformer \u57fa\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f30\u8ba1\u6b8b\u5dee\u6062\u590d\u906e\u6321\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 TrackNetV2 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a F1 \u5206\u6570 0.9859\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387 0.9733\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u4ee3\uff0c\u6bd4 V4 \u4ec5\u589e 3.7% FLOPs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0 SOTA \u6027\u80fd\u8dc3\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u8d8a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage.

We also propose \\textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning.

However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPhyCustom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff08\u7b49\u8ddd\u635f\u5931\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u64c5\u957f\u5177\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u98ce\u683c\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u7269\u7406\u8bcd\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "PhyCustom\u7ec6\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b49\u8ddd\u635f\u5931\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\u6d88\u9664\u72ec\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524dSOTA\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCustom\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift.

We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization.

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "U4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e4D LiDAR\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u96be\u5230\u6613\u201d\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742/\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u9650\u52364D\u4e16\u754c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6311\u6218\u533a\u57df\uff1b2. \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u91cd\u6784\u9ad8\u71b5\u533a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u8865\u5168\uff08\u5269\u4f59\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5408\u6210\uff09\uff1b3.
