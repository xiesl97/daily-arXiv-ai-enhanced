Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery."}

To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream."}

This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what \"understanding\" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will \"derive fundamental physics\" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose \"pragmatic understanding\" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it."}

A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the \"X-Ray Dot\" (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 6400\\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\\rm FWHM \\sim 2700-3200\\,km\\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\\textrm{2$-$10$\\,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\\,$erg$\\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties."}

The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $Γ=2.11\\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \\sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Solar eruptions arise from instabilities or loss of equilibria in the solar atmosphere, but routinely inferring the precise magnetic and plasma properties that lead to eruptions is not currently practical using synoptic solar observations. Data driven simulations offer an appealing alternative. We test our boundary data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach, based on the method of characteristics, on a simulation that includes full MHD, a stratified atmosphere, and the emergence of a model solar magnetic active region, from the photosphere upwards. The driven simulation is tested against a larger, ab initio ``Ground Truth'' simulation that extends downward into the convection zone. Our driven simulation accurately reproduces the dynamic emergence of the active region above the photosphere, the formation of key topological features throughout the corona, and the subsequent eruption of mass and magnetic field. The total emerged energy matches to better than one percent, the ratio of emerged to eruptive energy is $\\approx2\\%$, and the actual values of each energy term agree to within $10\\%$ between the two cases. Crucially, the data injection cadence, when properly scaled, matches the cadence of synoptic observations of the Sun's surface magnetic field, and is three to four orders of magnitude longer than the inherent CFL time step of the simulations. The stability of the code and fidelity of the results over an entire active region lifetime, from emergence to eruption, strongly suggests that our method will produce reliable results when driven using solar synoptic observations from existing and anticipated ground and spaced based observatories."}

In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in the regime where the dark-energy scalar field undergoes coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential. We show that the standard effective fluid description breaks down in this phase and develop a consistent field-based perturbation framework, which we use to assess the impact of oscillatory dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures."}

It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history."}

This is a crucial range of separation that is often inaccessible to searches of binary stars, providing a unique opportunity to examine their statistical properties. In particular, we have performed an analysis of rapid rotators in young moving groups. We examined their fraction as a function of the stellar density of the population in which they are found. We find that there is a deficit of rapid rotators in dense clusters such as the Orion Nebula in comparison to the more diffuse parts of the Orion Complex, as intracluster interactions with neighboring stars likely dissolve binaries with intermediate separations before they had a chance to fully form. In contrast, in older populations with an age of $\\sim100$ Myr, mass segregation redistributes binaries relative to single stars, thus in such older regions, rapid rotators are predominantly found in the regions of higher stellar density. This work sheds light on both the conditions that lead to the formation of binary stars and their dynamical evolution."}

As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\\log (M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})> 11.5$) at 0.15 < z < 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z < 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z ~ 0.8.

However, its significance for astrophysical phenomena, including particle acceleration, has yet to be appreciated. MP-energized particles tap energy from magnetic-field oscillations. A particle's momentum component perpendicular to the local B-field increases during field growth by virtue of the adiabatic invariant $p_{\\perp}^{2}/B=const$. The gained $p_{\\perp}$ is then partially scattered elastically into the parallel momentum, $p_{\\parallel}$, with $p^{2}=p_{\\parallel}^{2}+p_{\\perp}^{2}=const$, thereby retaining some fraction of the gained energy before the field decreases to its minimum. This scattering breaks the reversibility of energy exchange between particles and oscillating magnetic fields, thereby increasing the particle energy after each MP cycle. Field oscillations are often assumed to be sinusoidal, and the resulting MP is treated perturbatively. These simplifications restrict astrophysical applications, leaving objects with strong magnetic perturbations outside the scope of adequate treatment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to MP that is suitable for a broad spectrum of magnetic turbulence. The treatment comprises two steps. The first step is common: converting a kinetic equation into an infinite hierarchy of moments of the particle distribution function. The second step is new in MP treatments: we find an exact closure at an arbitrary level of the moment system. The heating is treated exactly at the second-moment closure. Particle acceleration generally requires a higher-level closure to determine the power-law index and the maximum energy of accelerated particles. We propose a method for extracting these crucial acceleration data from the second moment for a broadband random field."}

However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M_\\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem."}

However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \\,$M$_{\\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems."}

Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur's wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \\textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System."}

These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors."}

We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $α$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way."}

Zahn's tidal equations \\cite{1977A&A....57..383Z, 1989A&A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $μ$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication.

The traditional disturbing function expansion in celestial mechanics shows that, at low eccentricities, $p$:$p-q$ MMRs exhibit a clear hierarchy of strengths, scaling as $e^q$, where $q$ is the order of the resonance. This explains why first-order MMRs (e.g., 3:2 and 4:3) are important, while the infinite number of higher order integer ratios are not. However, this relationship derived from a technical perturbation series expansion provides little physical intuition. In this paper, we provide a simple physical explanation of this result for closely spaced orbits. In this limit, interplanetary interactions are negligible except during close encounters at conjunction, where the planets impart a gravitational \"kick\" to each other's mean motion. We show that while first-order MMRs involve a single conjunction before the configuration repeats, higher order MMRs involve multiple conjunctions per cycle, whose effects cancel out more precisely the higher the order of the resonance.

This structure is interpreted as the interference patterns of high-frequency acoustic waves excited in the solar interior and propagating into the atmosphere, known as pseudomodes. Pseudomodes exhibit clear solar-cycle variability, with frequency shifts that occur predominantly in anti-phase with the activity cycle, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This work investigates how the subsurface excitation source location and the photospheric acoustic cut-off frequency influence the formation, frequency distribution, and solar-cycle variability of pseudomodes. We employ an analytical Klein-Gordon subsurface cavity model, which is shown to act as an effective Fabry-Pérot interferometer for high-frequency waves that experience constructive and destructive interference between the source location and the lower turning point. We derive an effective dispersion relation isolating the effects of the source location and photospheric cut-off on the pseudomode frequency. The model reproduces the observed peak-trough pseudomode spectrum for reasonable parameter values constrained by Bayesian MCMC best-fitting to GONG observations. We also find that solar-cycle-associated 11-year modulations of the source location result in anti-phase pseudomode frequency shifts, whereas similar cyclic variations in the cut-off frequency produce harmonic-dependent behaviour, yielding both in-phase and anti-phase shifts. As the acoustic cut-off and mode excitation relate to stratification and flows in the solar interior, the results highlight pseudomodes as a powerful diagnostic tool for changes in subsurface solar and stellar structure through the solar cycle."}

Despite its fewer degrees of freedom per pixel compared to the Planck 2015 legacy dust model, we find that this new model performs competitively in terms of overall residuals, capturing over 98% of the full-sky dust variance for all channels. When fitting a spatially varying 3-parameter MBB model to the new dust model with isotropic SEDs, we find very similar spatial distributions to those of the official Planck analysis, and this new model thus represents an economical decomposition of previously published spatially varying spectral parameter maps. We conclude that this new model represents both a statistically more efficient summary of thermal dust in the microwave and far-infrared regimes and a physically more realistic decomposition of the sky compared to the traditional 3-parameter MBB model.

Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (>= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z < 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope."}

Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\\sim1.6\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year.

For stacked samples of $\\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim1\\times10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\\lesssim7.0\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year.

At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance."}

Half of the spectra were taken during quiescence and the rest during a burst or at intermediate brightness. Our analysis of their ten-year light curves and photometric/spectroscopic features provide evidence that all 16 sources are accreting Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). One object, Gaia23bab, is a known EXor source. Other light curves either have peaks over a stable baseline, or significant variability throughout the entire observation period, suggesting multiple contributing processes. All spectra exhibit emission lines from accretion columns, and over half of them show atomic forbidden lines as signatures of outflowing gas. We determined stellar parameters, accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) at different brightness phases. Only two sources showed variability primarily due to extinction. During quiescence, our sources exhibit Lacc and Macc values typical of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBE) sources, supporting the hypothesis that any YSO may undergo episodic accretion. In bursts, the Lacc and Macc of sources with photometric variations exceeding 2 mag follow a shallower relation with stellar luminosity and mass, typical of known EXor sources. This group includes one Class I, one flat-spectrum, and two Class II sources. Notably, the other Class I source, Gaia24beh, shows an Lacc value about ten times higher than typical EXor bursts of the same mass. In the other cases, Lacc and Macc align with variability seen in T Tauri and HAEBE sources."}

We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+βρ_m^{n}+γ$, where $γ$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+βρ_m+γρ_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\\to$matter$\\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term. In contrast, Case~B admits a qualitatively distinct and phenomenologically appealing branch: for $0<n<1/2$ the system possesses a physical \\emph{scaling} de~Sitter future attractor inside the bounded simplex, yielding radiation$\\to$matter$\\to$acceleration with $q=-1$ and $ω_{\\rm eff}=-1$ and without introducing $c_0$.

These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors."}

These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients."}

We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and C2H, tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the HD 163296 system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\\pm7$ au and azimuth $φ=46\\pm3^\\circ$ (or $R=0.75''$, $\\rm{PA}=350^\\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD--isolated with a 7$σ$ significance--we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet's Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T > 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\\rm p} < 1.0$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$, and CPD radii $R_{\\rm CPD} < 2$ au."}

The achieved H $α$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $α$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction.

However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\\rm proj}\\leq0.8$~Mpc and $ΔV\\leq250$~km~s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\\sim$71\\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\\sim$29\\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales."}

Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling."}

We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z>5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs.

However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M_\\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem."}

In this work, we aim to derive precision extinction estimates for APOGEE DR19 stars, establishing a new benchmark for Galactic stellar population studies. We first determine reddening by comparing observed colorsr, etrieved from photometric surveys or standardized synthetic magnitudes from Gaia BP/RP spectra, to intrinsic colors predicted via an XGBoost model. The model is trained on minimally reddened stars to infer intrinsic colors and their associated uncertainties, using APOGEE stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]). The derived reddening values are then converted into extinctions using an anchor ratio of A_BP / A_RP = 1.694 +/- 0.004, derived from red-clump-like stars. Here, we provide extinction measurements in 39 filters across 10 photometric systems and introduce a new empirical extinction curve optimized for broadband passbands. Our extinction estimates (Av) outperform existing results (Bayestar19, StarHorse, SEDEX), achieving a typical precision of 0.03 mag in Av. Notably, we identify systematic deviations of up to 30% between monochromatic and passband-integrated extinction ratios at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. This result highlights the necessity of adopting passband-specific coefficients when correcting extinction to derive stellar parameters. As the foundation for a forthcoming series of papers, these benchmark measurements will be used to (1) revise asteroseismic scaling relations, (2) calibrate differential reddening in open clusters, and (3) reconcile heterogeneous dust maps into a unified, all-sky extinction scheme."}

In the $z=2.91$ lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of $\\gtrsim 300$, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of $\\lesssim 0.8-1.5$ pc. The $z=6.70$ system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling.

The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1--2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3--46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\\gtrsim$300 and $\\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power."}

This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution."}

We evaluate the simulated open magnetic flux at 1.01~$R_s$, 3~$R_s$, and 0.1~AU, and compare them with interplanetary observations. The results show that the simulated unsigned open flux evaluated near the solar surface can be comparable to that derived from interplanetary in situ observations. However, in low corona, numerous small-scale closed-field magnetic structures introduce magnetic polarity inversion interfaces within the open field, cancelling part of the open field near these interfaces during the volume-integration procedure of the finite-volume method. Consequently, the simulated unsigned open flux can be reduced by up to 45% at 0.1~AU and decreases more rapidly in the low corona. The results also indicate that moderate adjustments to the heating source term can effectively regulate the magnitude of the unsigned open magnetic flux. Preprocessing the initial magnetogram by a PF solver with limited spherical harmonics can reduce the open flux in the low corona and alter the distribution of open-field regions, but has little effect on the total unsigned open flux at larger heliocentric distances. The ratio of the maximum to minimum open unsigned magnetic flux can reach 1.4 within a single solar maximum CR. These findings highlight the necessity of considering finer grid resolution around magnetic polarity inversion interfaces, more realistic heating mechanisms, and the time-evolving regime of MHD coronal modelling when further addressing the ``open flux problem\"."}

We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \\,$M$_{\\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z_{\\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$α$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$α$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$α$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$α$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$α$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$α$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth."}

We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $α$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way."}

Zahn's tidal equations \\cite{1977A&A....57..383Z, 1989A&A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $μ$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution"}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $α$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\\times 10^{-17}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4<z<1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $α$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $α$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed."}

Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery."}

These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients."}

This is a crucial range of separation that is often inaccessible to searches of binary stars, providing a unique opportunity to examine their statistical properties. In particular, we have performed an analysis of rapid rotators in young moving groups. We examined their fraction as a function of the stellar density of the population in which they are found. We find that there is a deficit of rapid rotators in dense clusters such as the Orion Nebula in comparison to the more diffuse parts of the Orion Complex, as intracluster interactions with neighboring stars likely dissolve binaries with intermediate separations before they had a chance to fully form. In contrast, in older populations with an age of $\\sim100$ Myr, mass segregation redistributes binaries relative to single stars, thus in such older regions, rapid rotators are predominantly found in the regions of higher stellar density. This work sheds light on both the conditions that lead to the formation of binary stars and their dynamical evolution."}

We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and C2H, tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the HD 163296 system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\\pm7$ au and azimuth $φ=46\\pm3^\\circ$ (or $R=0.75''$, $\\rm{PA}=350^\\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD--isolated with a 7$σ$ significance--we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet's Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T > 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\\rm p} < 1.0$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$, and CPD radii $R_{\\rm CPD} < 2$ au."}

Consider, for example, the elucidation of the components of the Galaxy over the past decades, its mapping as enabled by Gaia and its predecessors, the photometric and spectroscopic characterization of innumerable astrophysical objects in various wavelength ranges, both from the ground and from space, and the expanding discovery and characterization of exoplanets; all focused on the current, static Galaxy. This White Paper proposes a dedicated program to derive stellar ages from time-series spectroscopy to hasten the transformation of this static conception into a dynamical one with age-labeled objects and events."}

The method and a new extinction curve", "comment": "15 pages, 11 figures, 1 table. Submitted to MNRAS. Reddening and extinction values will become publicly available when the manuscript is accepted", "summary": "The scarcity of high-fidelity extinction measurements remains a bottleneck in deriving accurate stellar properties from Gaia parallaxes. In this work, we aim to derive precision extinction estimates for APOGEE DR19 stars, establishing a new benchmark for Galactic stellar population studies. We first determine reddening by comparing observed colorsr, etrieved from photometric surveys or standardized synthetic magnitudes from Gaia BP/RP spectra, to intrinsic colors predicted via an XGBoost model. The model is trained on minimally reddened stars to infer intrinsic colors and their associated uncertainties, using APOGEE stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]). The derived reddening values are then converted into extinctions using an anchor ratio of A_BP / A_RP = 1.694 +/- 0.004, derived from red-clump-like stars. Here, we provide extinction measurements in 39 filters across 10 photometric systems and introduce a new empirical extinction curve optimized for broadband passbands. Our extinction estimates (Av) outperform existing results (Bayestar19, StarHorse, SEDEX), achieving a typical precision of 0.03 mag in Av. Notably, we identify systematic deviations of up to 30% between monochromatic and passband-integrated extinction ratios at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. This result highlights the necessity of adopting passband-specific coefficients when correcting extinction to derive stellar parameters. As the foundation for a forthcoming series of papers, these benchmark measurements will be used to (1) revise asteroseismic scaling relations, (2) calibrate differential reddening in open clusters, and (3) reconcile heterogeneous dust maps into a unified, all-sky extinction scheme."}
