Abstract: We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.

TL;DR: 通过多波段观测发现NGC 6447的中红外亮度持续增加，光学亮度稳定，证实其从静止星系转变为活动星系核（AGN），揭示了AGN激活过程中遮蔽物质的逐渐消散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AGN从静止星系激活的初始阶段，探索遮蔽物质消散与AGN露出的过程。

Method: 利用WISE/NEOWISE的中红外光变曲线、ASAS-SN的光学光变数据、SPHEREx光谱和NuSTAR的X射线观测，综合分析NGC 6447的多波段特性。

Result: 发现中红外亮度14年间增加1.2星等，X射线光度为8.4×10^41 erg/s，支持AGN激活；估算AGN吸积事件持续时间为10^4-10^6年。

Conclusion: 长期红外变异性是探测AGN激活事件的有效工具，NGC 6447的观测结果为理解AGN激活过程提供了直接证据。

Abstract: It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.

### [3] [Retarded Stellar Dynamo in Tidally Deformed M Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21683)

Abstract: Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\rm cyc}$-$P_{\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.

Conclusion: 米拉变星的脉动和大气成分对其光谱行为有显著影响，为进一步理解这类恒星的演化和分类提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Mira stars are popular with amateur astronomers because they are generally bright and their pulsations produce large changes in brightness. This also means they are eminently suitable to study using spectroscopy. We report here on spectroscopic observations of five Mira stars: RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas and OR Cep. We describe the lifecycle of a Mira star and explain how the carbon-oxygen balance in its atmosphere determines its spectral classification. Atmospheric pulsations in these stars produce shocks which generate Balmer emission. We present graphically their different spectral behaviours and development of emission lines.

Abstract: We present a sound horizon independent measurement of the Hubble parameter using a multiprobe large-scale structure analysis. Removing the dependency on the sound horizon with a rescaling procedure at the matter power spectrum level, we analyse the BOSS full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum (for the first time) using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to one loop. We combine this analysis with the auto- and cross-angular power spectra from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, the $3 \times 2$pt analysis from DES Y3, and the CMB gravitational lensing power spectrum from Planck PR3. Our baseline analysis, that does not rely on supernovae data, yields $h = 0.702^{+0.022}_{-0.024}$, $Ω_m = 0.310 \pm 0.013$, and $σ_8 = 0.799 \pm 0.020$, corresponding to $3-4 \%$ precision measurements. When adding supernovae data from Pantheon+, we obtain a $2.6 \%$ measurement of $h$, with $h = 0.686 \pm 0.018$. We further note that our EFTBOSS analysis indicates a slight deviation of the BAO scale parameter (at $1.8 σ$) from its $Λ$CDM value, caused by the small scales of the bispectrum. We finally use the sound horizon-free EFTBOSS analysis as a diagnosis for the presence of new physics, finding that our results are consistent with the recent hints of evolving dark energy.
