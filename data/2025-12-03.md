TL;DR: 利用FloodsNet多模态数据集微调TerraMind地理空间基础模型（GFM），显著提升全球洪水事件范围映射性能，尤其在召回率上优于基线模型，提供高效近实时洪水监测方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是破坏性最强的气象灾害，2024年极端洪水影响五大洲社区。地球观测（EO）卫星提供关键覆盖，但操作精度依赖标注数据集和模型泛化。GFM如TerraMind通过大规模自监督预训练提升泛化，但其在多样全球洪水事件上的性能尚未充分评估。

Method: 使用FloodsNet数据集（85个全球洪水事件，融合Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学影像）微调TerraMind的四种配置（base/large模型；frozen/unfrozen骨干）。与TerraMind的Sen1Floods11示例及在FloodsNet+Sen1Floods11上训练的U-Net进行比较。

Result: base-unfrozen配置在准确率、精确率、召回率间取得最佳平衡，且计算成本远低于large模型；large-unfrozen召回率最高；FloodsNet训练的GFM在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11示例，总体准确率相当；U-Net召回率高于所有GFM配置，但准确率和精确率略低。

Conclusion: 多模态光学和SAR数据整合结合GFM微调可增强近实时洪水映射。该研究首次在全球尺度评估GFM用于洪水分割，凸显其在气候适应和灾害韧性方面的潜力与当前局限。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比学习中增强样本导致信息扭曲，提出包含两个收敛目标的上下文丰富对比损失函数：标签敏感组件提升对比效率，同源图像组件缓解扭曲。在8大基准数据集上优于16个SOTA方法，提高泛化性能、收敛速度，尤其在BiasedMNIST上改善22.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习损失函数过度依赖同标签样本，忽略同初始图像的正样本对，导致信息扭曲，尤其在大规模数据集。

Method: 提出上下文丰富对比损失函数，包括两个组件：1）标签对比敏感组件，区分同异类特征，提升训练效率；2）拉近同源图像增强样本，推远其他样本，缓解扭曲。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100、Caltech-101/256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace、CelebA等8数据集上，优于16个SOTA对比学习方法，提高泛化性能和收敛速度；在BiasedMNIST下游任务上比原损失改善22.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在系统性扭曲任务中表现出色，有望实现更高效、公平的下游训练。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出联合评估T2I模型和VLM的结构化方法，通过VLM识别T2I在挑战性提示下生成的图像中的27种特定失败模式，并构建包含5个T2I模型图像及VLM标注的数据集，揭示属性保真度和物体表示的系统性错误，强调当前指标不足，需要针对性基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型虽生成视觉印象深刻的图像，但常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性（如物体数量和颜色），错误多样性凸显需要分层评估框架比较不同模型的提示遵守能力；同时，VLM基准未跟上其用于标注的场景复杂性。

Method: 提出联合评估T2I和VLM的结构化方法：测试VLM是否能识别T2I模型（Flux、SD3-Medium、SD3-Large、SD3.5-Medium、SD3.5-Large）在挑战性提示下生成的图像中的27种失败模式；构建数据集，包括提示、生成图像及VLM（Molmo、InternVL3、Pixtral）的标注，由LLM（Llama3）验证标注准确性。

Result: 通过精选提示集分析失败模式，揭示T2I模型在属性保真度（attribute fidelity）和物体表示（object representation）方面的系统性错误；当前评估指标无法捕捉这些细微错误。

Conclusion: 现有指标不足以全面评估细微错误，强调开发针对性基准以提升生成模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Hear What Matters! Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02650)
*Junwon Lee,Juhan Nam,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文引入文本条件选择性视频到音频（V2A）生成新任务，从多物体视频中仅产生用户指定声音。提出SelVA模型，将文本提示作为目标源选择器，调制视频编码器提取相关特征；补充令牌抑制无关激活，促进跨注意力；自增强克服单声道监督缺失。在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准上，验证音频质量、语义对齐和时序同步优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体制作需单独处理各声源音频以实现精确编辑、混音和创意控制，但现有V2A方法因视觉特征纠缠及区域提示失效，仅生成混合声音，缺乏选择性。

Method: SelVA使用文本提示显式选择目标源，调制视频编码器提取提示相关特征；补充令牌通过高效参数调优抑制文本无关激活，促进跨注意力，实现语义和时序对齐；自增强方案生成伪单声道监督。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准上评估，广泛实验和消融验证SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时序同步方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: SelVA有效解决选择性V2A生成挑战，代码与演示公开可用。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.

### [5] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于医疗图像预测癌症体细胞突变谱的深度潜在变量模型LLOST，使用病灶点云表示和双变分自编码器共享潜在空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗效果依赖早期诊断和个性化治疗，医疗成像用于初步诊断，遗传信息用于治疗选择，本文通过图像直接预测突变谱以加速干预。

Method: 引入病灶图像点云表示实现成像模态不变性；提出LLOST模型，双VAE通过共享潜在空间耦合图像点云和突变计数特征，共三个潜在空间各用条件 normalizing flow 先验学习。

Result: 在TCIA图像和TCGA突变数据上定性和定量实验显示，对特定突变计数和发生准确预测，并揭示图像与突变域的共享模式反映癌种。

Conclusion: 讨论模型改进和未来扩展至其他遗传域的研究方向。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [6] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SplatSuRe方法，通过相机姿态相对场景几何选择性地对3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)的欠采样区域应用超分辨率（SR），避免多视图不一致，提升渲染锐度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS实现高质量新视图合成，但训练视图分辨率低；直接对低分辨率（LR）视图独立应用SR导致多视图不一致和模糊；现有方法统一SR或用神经/时序先验缓解，但忽略近距离LR视图的高频信息利用。

Method: 利用相机姿态与场景几何关系识别缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域，仅在这些区域选择性添加SR内容，实现联合优化。

Result: 在Tanks &amp; Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，超越基线方法，在保真度（fidelity）和感知质量（perceptual quality）上均有提升，尤其前景局部区域显著。

Conclusion: SplatSuRe产生更锐利、更一致的高分辨率渲染，尤其适用于需要高细节的前景区域。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [7] [MRD: Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection Fusion for High-Resolution Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02906)
*Fan Yang,Kaihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MRD（Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection）无训练框架，通过多分辨率语义融合和开放词汇目标检测（OVD），解决MLLMs高分辨率图像理解中对象碎片化问题，提升语义准确性和对象完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像对MLLMs理解构成挑战，现裁剪+RAG方法导致对象跨裁剪碎片化，扰乱语义相似度计算；实验观察到不同大小对象适宜不同分辨率处理。

Method: 1. 多分辨率语义融合：不同分辨率获取语义相似度图并融合，修正偏差并保留对象完整性；2. OVD模型采用滑动窗口实现全局尺度目标对象直接定位。

Result: 在高分辨率图像理解基准上，使用不同MLLMs实验验证MRD有效性。

Conclusion: MRD作为无训练框架，有效提升高分辨率图像理解性能，优于裁剪基线。

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [8] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RobustSurg方法，通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射分离风格与内容，并引入补偿模块保留任务相关特征，提升手术场景分割的泛化能力。同时提供新数据集，在未见中心和模态上显著优于基线和SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习手术场景分割方法在单中心单模态数据上表现好，但对未见分布（如其他中心）和未见模态泛化差。自然场景的OOD泛化方法无法直接应用于手术场景，因视觉线索有限且场景多样。假设利用风格和内容信息减少外观变化（如血液、伪影）的影响。

Method: 在ResNet主干中使用实例归一化和特征协方差映射获得鲁棒特征表示；引入补偿模块保留对象相关显著特征； curation 新多类多中心数据集。

Result: 在CholecSeg8K训练，在未见HeiCholSeg数据集上mIoU比DeepLabv3+提升23%，比SOTA提升10-32%；在EndoUDA polyp数据集上比基线提升22%，比近期SOTA提升11%。

Conclusion: RobustSurg显著提升手术场景分割的泛化性能，为该领域提供新数据集和基准。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

*Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Zhuoran Yu,Samuel Low Yu Hang,Subin An,Jeongik Lee,Yohan Ban,SeungEun Chung,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,JuWan Maeng,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AV-SpeakerBench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在真实视频中的说话者中心视听推理能力，包含3212个多选题；Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，开源模型落后主要因视听融合不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准难以评估人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务仅视觉可解或粗略评估语音，无法洞察模型是否能对齐说话者、所说内容及发生时机。

Method: 构建AV-SpeakerBench：(1)以说话者而非场景为核心推理单元；(2)融合 grounding 问题设计，将视听依赖嵌入问题语义；(3)专家精选标注，确保时序精确性和跨模态有效性。

Result: Gemini系列模型优于开源系统，Gemini 2.5 Pro最佳；开源中Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但远逊Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要弱于视听融合而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统推进细粒度视听推理奠定严谨基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元用于SNN图像去雨，引入脉冲分解增强模块和轻量级多尺度单元，实现分层多尺度表示学习，以13%能耗超越SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在低级视觉任务如图像去雨中未充分探索，传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解和高频饱和问题。

Method: 创新VLIF神经元捕捉高通特性；脉冲分解增强模块解决频域饱和；轻量级脉冲多尺度单元实现分层多尺度学习。

Result: 在五个去雨基准数据集上显著超越SOTA SNN方法，仅用其13%能耗。

Conclusion: 为SNN在高性能、低能耗低级视觉任务部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出时空金字塔流（SPF），一种分层流匹配方法，用于高效多时间尺度气候仿真，优于基线，并发布最大气候模拟数据集ClimateSuite。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往生成气候模型依赖天气尺度自回归，长时间仿真慢，且在非平稳强迫下 rollout 不稳定。

Method: SPF 将生成轨迹分区为时空金字塔，渐增空间分辨率，每阶段耦合对应时间尺度，并条件于物理强迫（如温室气体、气溶胶），支持任意时间级直接采样。

Result: 在ClimateBench上，年/月尺度优于流匹配基线和预训练模型，采样高效；使用ClimateSuite（33,000+模拟年，10个气候模型，包括干预模拟），扩展SPF模型对未见场景泛化良好。

Conclusion: SPF与ClimateSuite为基础，提供准确、高效、概率化气候仿真，支持多时间尺度和真实未来场景。数据代码开源：https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用CogVideo进行图像恢复，通过微调生成从退化到清晰帧的恢复轨迹，支持超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频模型在时序生成上强大，但图像恢复潜力未充分探索。

Method: 构建合成数据集，每样本展示从退化到清晰帧的渐变；比较统一文本提示和基于LLaVA+ChatGPT的场景特定提示；微调CogVideo将时序进展与恢复质量关联。

Result: 生成序列提升PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS等指标；恢复空间细节和光照一致性，保持时序连贯性；在ReLoBlur数据集零样本泛化强劲。

Conclusion: CogVideo有效实现渐进视觉恢复，具有时序连贯性和零样本鲁棒性及可解释性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

Method: 两阶段框架：阶段A采用形态区域扰动（Morphological Region Perturbation），基于曲率引导的标签空间方法生成油和似油区域真实几何变异；阶段B使用条件生成INADE模型从编辑掩码渲染SAR-like纹理。构建秘鲁数据集（2112个512×512标签补丁，来自40个2014-2024 Sentinel-1场景），与地中海CleanSeaNet基准协调，评估七种分割架构。

Result: 地中海预训练模型在秘鲁域mIoU从67.8%降至51.8%；MORP-Synth提升高达+6 mIoU，油类IoU +10.8，看-alike类IoU +14.6。

Conclusion: MORP-Synth有效提升跨域转移性能，特别是少数类分割精度。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Motivation: 计算机视觉中通过运动区分视觉相似物体仍具挑战；监督跟踪器有效但自监督方法在视觉模糊时失效，限制无标签数据的可扩展性和泛化。

Method: 发现预训练视频扩散模型在去噪早期阶段自然隔离并学习运动表示（不同于后期外观细化），据此开发无需任务特定训练的自监督跟踪器。

Result: 在标准基准和新视觉相似物体跟踪测试上，比近期自监督方法提升高达6个百分点；可视化验证对相同物体在视点变化和形变下的鲁棒跟踪。

Conclusion: 扩散模型派生的运动表示填补现有方法的盲点，实现视觉相似甚至相同物体的可靠跟踪。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Conclusion: 更适合实际部署，代码开源。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效桥接冻结模型不变性与未见域多样性，实现强大泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: generate a too long; didn't read summary for the following paper abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: LightHCG提升了AI青光眼检测的可靠性和效率，并增强了干预分析和临床模拟的应用潜力。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

TL;DR: BOLT是一种框架，通过从多个任务微调模型中提取正交谱基，并在该子空间内进行低秩适应，实现高效的任务转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模预训练模型适应未见任务时，数据和计算资源有限。元学习虽能学习良好初始化，但需额外元训练阶段，成本高且不稳定。现有任务特定模型众多，但如何最小训练转移至新任务未充分探索。

Method: 离线阶段：从多个任务向量中收集主导奇异方向，按层正交化形成可复用基。线上阶段：冻结这些基，仅训练每层少量对角系数，实现秩控制更新。提供无训练初始化（池化源任务系数+轻量重缩放）和参数高效微调（PEFT）路径。

Result: 实验中，优于常见PEFT基线和元学习初始化，在未见任务转移中表现出色。

Conclusion: 将适应约束在任务信息正交子空间中，为未见任务转移提供有效替代方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)增强SNN的时序信息建模能力，包括Spiking Encoder (SE)生成多样化时序输入和Attention Gating Module (AGM)，并用Spike-Driven Attention (SDA)降低能耗，在目标检测任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN直接复制输入或固定间隔聚合帧，导致神经元时序刺激相似，限制模型在复杂任务如目标检测的表达能力。

Method: TDE由Spiking Encoder (SE)（生成跨时步多样输入刺激）和Attention Gating Module (AGM)（基于时序依赖指导SE生成）组成；引入Spike-Driven Attention (SDA)消除AGM中的高能乘法运算，降低注意力机制能耗。

Result: TDE无缝集成到SNN检测器中，在静态PASCAL VOC数据集上mAP50-95达57.7%，神经形态EvDET200K数据集上达47.6%，优于SOTA；SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE显著提升SNN在时序建模和目标检测性能，同时大幅降低能耗，具有高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: nuScenes作为广泛使用的数据集，其关键趋势（如首次包含雷达、多大陆场景、自主车辆收集、多模态融合、标准化基准、多任务支持）需深入揭示未公开细节，追踪其对社区影响，并综述相关文献。

Method: 总结nuScenes及扩展的创建技术细节；追溯其对后续数据集的影响与标准定义；概述官方/非官方任务，并回顾感知、定位、预测、规划等方法发展。

Result: 揭示nuScenes诸多未公布技术细节；展示其塑造社区标准与后续数据集；提供以nuScenes为中心自动驾驶研究的全面调研。

Conclusion: nuScenes及其扩展是AV/ADAS发展的基础，推动数据驱动深度学习、多模态融合与标准化，其影响持续至今。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型仅在合成简单单房间/单楼层数据集上训练，无法处理多楼层建筑，需拆分场景导致丢失全局空间上下文（如楼梯连接多层）。

Method: 构建HouseLayout3D基准数据集，覆盖真实多楼层复杂建筑；提出MultiFloor3D无训练基线，利用近期场景理解方法进行全建筑规模布局估计。

Result: MultiFloor3D在新基准HouseLayout3D及先前数据集上超越现有3D布局估计模型。

Conclusion: 强调全建筑规模布局估计需进一步研究，提供数据和代码：https://houselayout3d.github.io。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. Data and code are available at: https://houselayout3d.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在视觉感知与语言理解上进步显著，但多模态推理需准确感知与鲁棒推理，先前增强推理方法依赖昂贵高质量CoT数据（如人工标注、专有模型），自训练忽略感知。

Method: STL核心为结构化推理模板：先文本形式提取视觉属性（see），再指导推理（think）；自训练循环生成并学习自身结构化理由；数据增强负面理由（解释错误选项为何不对），提升辨别力。

Result: 跨多领域实验优于仅训答案或自生成推理基线；定性分析证实理由高质量。

Conclusion: STL为VLMs多模态推理提供高效低成本方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Motivation: 近期音视频生成系统表明模态耦合有益于同步性和视频质量。本文提出核心问题：即使仅关心视频质量，音视频联合去噪训练是否能改善视频生成？

Method: 引入参数高效的Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT)架构，利用预训练文本到视频(T2V)和文本到音频(T2A)模块进行联合去噪。训练(i) T2AV模型使用AVFullDiT，(ii) 相同条件下T2V-only对比模型。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 生成该论文摘要的TLDR总结：Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

Result: 在十个数据集上达到SOTA性能，高分辨率基准准确率提升5.0%，性能与效率平衡良好。

Conclusion: TGDD使合成数据保留语义多样性和代表性，提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Motivation: 视频世界模型能基于过去观察和动作生成高保真未来视觉，但长时时空一致性建模长期未解，主要因长上下文输入的计算成本过高。

Method: 设计压缩内存机制，包括轨迹打包实现高上下文效率，以及内存检索维持rollout一致性并支持需空间推理的长时生成。

Result: 在专为长时一致性评估的Minecraft基准LoopNav上，WorldPack显著优于最新SOTA模型。

Conclusion: WorldPack有效解决长时世界建模难题，提升空间一致性、视觉保真度和生成质量。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 视频对象分割本质上是复杂的推理任务，查询通常涉及动态、因果和时序交互，而非静态外观。现有的解决方案将这些因素塌缩到潜在嵌入中，导致推理链不透明且难以处理。

Result: 在标准视频对象分割基准上达到最先进性能，并生成可解释的推理轨迹。项目页面：https://clementine24.github.io/ReVSeg/。

Conclusion: ReVSeg通过显式分解和RL优化，提升了推理中心视频对象分割的性能和可解释性，对齐预训练模型能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

Result: 在多种3D场景语言基准和LLM基线上取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了其有效性，并强调了解码器设计在3D多模态推理中的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

*Mizuki Kikkawa,Tatsuya Yatagawa,Yutaka Ohtake,Hiromasa Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究揭示深度学习GMM点集配准方法（如DeepGMR）在部分-部分配准中的不变性问题，提出注意力参考点偏移（ARPS）层，通过寻找公共参考点实现变换不变特征，大幅提升性能并超越Transformer基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习GMM配准方法在输入点集平移旋转下特征向量缺乏不变性，导致部分-部分点集配准失效，特别是DeepGMR及其变体存在理论与实践局限，需要揭示原因并提供解决方案。

Method: 引入注意力基参考点偏移（ARPS）层，利用注意力模块识别两个部分点集的公共参考点而非重叠区，获取变换不变特征，并集成到DeepGMR和UGMMReg中。

Result: ARPS显著提升DeepGMR和UGMMReg性能，甚至优于使用注意力块或Transformer提取重叠区/参考点的先前深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 为深度学习与GMM点集配准方法提供更深层洞见，推动鲁棒部分-部分配准发展。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Conclusion: 将生成过程与数据内在结构对齐，是解锁复杂地理空间分析优异性能的关键。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）在计算机视觉中仍具挑战性，旨在通过两阶段训练策略提升Vision Transformer（ViT）的性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效，凸显自监督预训练在复杂图像恢复任务中的潜力，未来可探索更大ViT架构或替代预文本任务以进一步提升。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Motivation: DUSt3R后，VGGT和π³等多视图3D模型性能强，但全球自注意力计算成本高。现有稀疏注意力仅部分加速，缺乏全球注意力在多视图推理中作用的系统分析。

Method: 首先剖析VGGT和π³全球注意力模块角色：早期层不形成对应、中间层跨视图对齐、末层细化。随后提出无训练两步加速：(1)早期全球层转为帧注意力；(2)K/V子采样，保留对角并添加均值填充组件。在VGGT和π³上实例化，评估位姿和点图基准。

Conclusion: 分析指导的两步加速方案显著降低计算成本，同时维持或提升性能，优于现有稀疏方法。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Motivation: 现有深度学习遥感图像融合方法因真实训练数据有限及不同卫星传感器间的域间隙，导致在新数据集上泛化性能差。

Method: 构建多样化模拟数据集：对自然图像（ImageNet）和遥感图像（SkyScript）施加退化（模糊、噪声、下采样）和增强（波段生成、通道洗牌、高通滤波、颜色抖动等）；在此数据上预训练融合模型学习通用空间-谱表示；采用零样本/单样本范式，在六个真实数据集（WorldView-2/3/4、IKONOS、QuickBird、GaoFen-2）上评估全调优/冻结调优，支持CNN、Transformer、Mamba等架构。

Result: 预训练策略显著提升不同卫星传感器和成像条件下各种融合模型的泛化性能；在零样本场景中取得优越结果，单样本设置下展现出色适应能力，仅需少量真实数据。

Conclusion: 为跨域全色锐化提供实用解决方案，建立遥感图像融合任务泛化新基准，并为通过高级训练策略利用基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出混合VLM+OCR架构，使用ColPali的补丁级相似度分数过滤OCR提取的文档区域，实现精确区域检索，支持RAG，无需额外训练，开源Snappy实现，实证评估进行中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs如ColPali以图像嵌入整页进行检索，返回整个页面而非特定区域，限制RAG中精确上下文的使用；OCR系统提取带坐标的结构化文本，但缺乏语义相关性评估。

Method: 构建混合架构：以ColPali补丁级相似度分数作为OCR区域的空间相关性过滤器；形式化ViT补丁网格与OCR边界框的坐标映射；引入交集度量实现相关性传播；建立检索精度的理论界限；在推理时运行，无需训练。

Result: 发布开源Snappy实现，展示实际适用性；实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: 该方法统一VLM与OCR优势，提供无需训练的精确区域检索，具备实际应用潜力，实证验证持续推进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR 通过偏振前向引导与3DGS的双向耦合机制，实现高保真反射分离、全场景重建，支持实时渲染，无需环境贴图或严格材料假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF 支持镜面反射场景的新视角合成，但训练和渲染慢，依赖材料/视角假设；3DGS 实时渲染但反射重建不准，因反射-几何纠缠，添加延迟反射模块依赖环境贴图。

Method: 提出 PolarGuide-GSDR，建立偏振与3DGS的双向耦合：首先利用3DGS几何先验解析偏振歧义，然后精炼偏振信息引导3DGS的法线和球谐表示，实现反射分离和全场景重建。

Result: 在公共和自采集数据集上，实现镜面重建、法线估计、新视角合成的SOTA性能，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: 首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架，提供优越的可解释性和实时性能，用于复杂反射场景建模。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

TL;DR: 提出UAUTrack，一个统一的单流单阶段端到端反无人机（Anti-UAV）单目标跟踪框架，支持多模态（RGB、TIR、RGB-T）融合，通过文本先验提示策略聚焦UAV，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能并兼顾精度与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反UAV跟踪研究虽探索RGB、TIR及RGB-T模态，但缺乏统一跨模态协作框架；现有方法聚焦独立任务模型，忽略跨模态信息共享，多模态融合仍处于初级阶段，难以有效整合数据。

Method: UAUTrack采用单流单阶段端到端架构统一集成多模态；核心引入文本先验提示策略，引导模型跨场景关注UAV。

Result: 在Anti-UAV和DUT Anti-UAV数据集上达到SOTA性能；在Anti-UAV410数据集上实现精度与速度的良好权衡。

Conclusion: UAUTrack在多样反UAV场景中展现高精度与实用效率，验证了框架的有效性。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR有效解决轻量化问题，代码开源于GitHub。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有槽注意力方法不区分前景背景，导致背景干扰和真实数据上实例发现性能次优。

Method: 第一阶段：双槽竞争机制粗分解前景背景，聚类初始化槽。第二阶段：掩码槽注意力（一背景槽+多前景槽竞争）；伪掩码指导（自监督补丁亲和图）防过分割。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上广泛实验，FASA consistently 优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 验证了明确前景建模和伪掩码指导对鲁棒场景分解及对象一致表示的有效性，代码即将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常分割需检测未知OoD物体，但异常数据稀缺且多样性不足，现有合成方法缺乏上下文连贯性和物理真实性，导致域间隙。

Method: ClimaDrive统一结构引导的多天气生成与提示驱动的异常修复，生成视觉真实训练数据，并构建涵盖六种驾驶场景的ClimaOoD基准。

Result: 在四个SOTA方法上训练ClimaOoD后，AUROC、AP提升，FPR95显著降低（如RbA在Fishyscapes LAF从3.97降至3.52）。

Conclusion: ClimaOoD提升模型在开放世界异常检测的泛化能力，提供宝贵训练数据。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出DF-Mamba，一种基于Mamba的视觉特征提取框架，用于3D手姿估计（HPE），有效处理手部遮挡，通过可变形状态扫描捕捉全局上下文，超越ResNet等CNN，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D手姿估计在双手重叠等严重遮挡场景下表现不佳，现方法依赖ResNet，其CNN归纳偏置无法有效建模局部特征与全局上下文（如关节间、手间或场景线索）的关系。

Method: 采用Mamba状态空间模型，通过选择性状态建模和提出的可变形状态扫描，从卷积后局部特征中聚合图像特征，选择性保留代表全局上下文的有用线索，实现高效全局上下文捕捉。

Result: 在五个数据集（单手/双手、手物交互、RGB/深度）上全面评估，DF-Mamba超越VMamba和Spatial-Mamba等最新骨干，在所有数据集上达到SOTA性能，推理速度与ResNet-50相当。

Conclusion: DF-Mamba提供了一种有效高效的特征提取框架，显著提升结构化3D HPE准确性，尤其适用于遮挡手交互场景。

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在多项任务上评估，GeoLoc预训练显著提升GeoBridge的地理定位准确性，促进跨域泛化和跨模态知识转移。

Conclusion: 验证了方法的有效性，并开源数据集、代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Motivation: VLMs在图像理解上表现出色，但视觉令牌过多导致计算成本高，无法部署到移动设备。现剪枝方法忽略令牌间冗余或空间关系，导致保留重复令牌或目标物体区域覆盖不足。

Method: 提出VLM-Pruner，包括离心令牌剪枝范式（近到远选择，优先保留物体细节）、空间稀疏缓冲（BSS）准则（延迟选择空间远处令牌）、并行贪婪策略高效选择，以及融合丢弃令牌显著信息到保留令牌以减少信息丢失。

Result: 在五个VLMs上以88.9%剪枝率 consistently 优于强基线，实现端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在高剪枝率下保持性能并显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

TL;DR: 对抗训练意外提高了对抗样本的可迁移性，揭示了一个新风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习虽在计算机视觉中取得成功，但易受对抗攻击影响。对抗训练是主要防御方法，但其对抗攻击可迁移性的影响未被充分探索。本文探讨对抗训练是否无意中增加了对抗样本的可迁移性。

Method: 训练了36个多样化模型，包括CNN和ViT，进行全面的可迁移性实验。

Result: 对抗训练（AT）模型生成的扰动比标准模型更有效地迁移，揭示了一个悖论，并引入新的生态系统风险。

Conclusion: 发布所有模型、代码和实验脚本以便复现和进一步研究。主张鲁棒性评估不仅应考察模型对迁移攻击的抵抗力，还应评估其生成可迁移对抗样本的倾向。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

TL;DR: 提出GeoViS框架，将遥感视觉 grounding 重新表述为渐进式搜索与推理过程，通过树状视觉线索序列探索图像，整合多模态感知、空间推理和奖励引导探索，实现小目标检测与场景整体感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉grounding上取得进展，但应用于遥感图像时面临挑战：目标在千米级场景中极小，查询涉及复杂地理空间关系如相对位置、空间层次或远距离对象上下文依赖。

Method: GeoViS：地理空间奖励视觉搜索框架，不直接一步预测位置，而是通过树状序列视觉线索主动探索全局图像，迭代精炼地理空间假设，整合多模态感知、空间推理和奖励引导探索。

Result: 在五个遥感grounding基准上进行广泛实验，GeoViS在关键视觉grounding指标上持续超越现有方法，展现强大跨域泛化与可解释性。

Conclusion: GeoViS实现精确地理空间理解，突出其在遥感视觉grounding中的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有UAV图像定位方法依赖大规模配对UAV-卫星数据集训练，该数据获取成本高且不易获得，限制了方法适用性。

Method: 采用无需UAV图像的训练范式，直接从卫星视图参考图像学习；通过专用增强策略模拟卫星与真实UAV视图间的视觉域转移；引入高效CAEVL模型。

Result: 在社区发布的挑战性ViLD真实UAV图像数据集上验证，与使用配对数据训练的现有最优方法相比性能竞争力强。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且泛化能力强，无需昂贵配对数据即可实现高性能UAV图像定位，并发布ViLD数据集。

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）实时渲染高保真外观但存在多视图不一致，几何精度差；2D高斯溅射（2DGS）确保多视图一致但纹理细节不足。

Method: 引入混合高斯光栅化实现统一渲染、自适应类型交换动态调整2D/3D高斯、频率解耦优化发挥各自优势，CUDA加速训练与推理。

Result: 在渲染质量、几何精度和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EGGS为AR/VR/自动驾驶等应用提供高品质NVS的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet是一种新型注意力增强深度学习框架，利用Sentinel-2卫星图像进行甲烷羽流检测，通过融合NDMI和注意力U-Net，显著降低假阳性，提高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，准确检测排放源对气候变化应对至关重要。传统方法依赖波段差比，易产生假阳性需专家验证；现有深度学习方法缺乏甲烷特异性特征优先机制。

Method: 提出AttMetNet：融合归一化差值甲烷指数（NDMI）与注意力增强U-Net架构，联合利用NDMI的羽流敏感线索和注意力驱动特征选择；采用焦点损失处理类别不平衡；使用真实甲烷羽流数据集训练。

Result: 广泛实验显示，AttMetNet在甲烷羽流检测中超越现有方法，假阳性率更低，精度召回平衡更好，IoU更高。

Conclusion: AttMetNet建立了首个针对真实卫星图像鲁棒甲烷羽流检测的专属架构，实现背景噪声抑制和甲烷吸收特征放大。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

Motivation: 现有视频基准基于物理常识，无法充分检验模型对真实世界科学定律的零样本推理能力，需要新基准评估视频模型作为“推理者”的科学理解。

Method: 构建200个精心设计的提示，每个编码多科学概念复合场景；对7个SOTA视频模型生成视频进行专家标注评估，覆盖5维度（Prompt Consistency、Phenomenon Congruency、Correct Dynamism、Immutability、Spatio-Temporal Continuity），采用VLM-as-a-Judge方法，与人类评估对比。

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

TL;DR: LumiX是一个结构化扩散框架，从文本提示联合生成一组内在属性图（反照率、辐照度、法线、深度、最终颜色），提供场景的结构化和物理一致描述。通过Query-Broadcast Attention和Tensor LoRA实现稳定联合训练，优于SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从文本提示联合生成多个物理一致的内在属性图，导致不连贯和不准确的场景描述，需要一个统一框架来生成全面、连贯的内在地图。

Method: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention：在每个自注意力块中跨所有地图共享查询，确保结构一致性。2) Tensor LoRA：基于张量的参数高效适应方法，建模跨地图关系，支持高效联合扩散训练。

Result: 生成连贯且物理有意义的内在图，对齐度提高23%，偏好分数0.19（优于SOTA的-0.41）；支持同一框架下的图像条件内在分解。

Conclusion: LumiX通过关键创新实现稳定联合生成多个内在属性，显著优于现有方法，在文本到内在生成和图像分解中表现出色。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

TL;DR: TrackNetV5 通过 MDD 模块恢复方向先验和 R-STR 头处理遮挡，在 TrackNetV2 数据集上实现 F1 0.9859 的新 SOTA，仅增加 3.7% FLOPs 保持实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TrackNet V1-V3 依赖纯视觉在遮挡时失效，V4 引入运动但绝对差分丢弃极性导致方向歧义，需要克服这些瓶颈。

Method: TrackNetV5 集成 MDD 模块（分解时序为带符号极性场编码方向）和 R-STR 头（Transformer 基粗到精，利用因子化时空上下文估计残差恢复遮挡目标）。

Result: 在 TrackNetV2 数据集上 F1 分数 0.9859、准确率 0.9733，显著优于前代，比 V4 仅增 3.7% FLOPs。

Conclusion: 实现新 SOTA 性能跃升，提供优越跟踪精度同时维持实时推理能力。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

TL;DR: 本文针对图像编辑多模态模型开源与闭源性能差距，提出轻量级端到端数据管道生成10M规模高质量数据集UnicEdit-10M，并引入UnicBench基准与新指标评估模型局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强大闭源模型如GPT-4o等快速发展，开源模型落后，主要因大规模高质量训练数据稀缺及缺乏诊断多样编辑行为的全面基准；现有数据构建方法存在规模-质量权衡问题。

Method: 引入轻量级数据管道：用端到端模型替换多工具链，并统一后验证阶段；训练7B双任务专家模型Qwen-Verify用于故障检测和指令重标注；生成UnicEdit-10M数据集；提出UnicBench基准评估空间和知识推理，引入Non-edit Consistency和Reasoning Accuracy等新指标。

Result: 构建10M规模UnicEdit-10M数据集覆盖基础和复杂编辑任务；在UnicBench上分析主流模型，揭示其局限性。

Conclusion: UnicBench分析揭示主流模型弱点，并为未来研究提供明确方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

Conclusion: 这是首个使用视频世界模型系统探索共享世界建模问题的工作。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散文本到图像定制方法擅长具体概念如风格形状，但对物理概念定制不足，因训练中缺乏物理知识输入，即使提示包含物理词也无法生成准确物理属性图像。

Method: PhyCustom细调框架，包括等距损失激活模型学习物理概念，和解耦损失消除独立概念混合学习。

Result: 在多样数据集上实验，定量和定性基准结果优于先前SOTA和流行方法。

Conclusion: PhyCustom在物理定制化方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 首次系统研究针对印度和南亚面部的身份保持AI生成内容（IP-AIGC）检测，发现现有检测器在微调后对保留身份编辑的测试集性能下降，表明过拟合训练生成器线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑器可生成身份保持的AIGC（IP-AIGC），现有检测器的鲁棒性和公平性不明朗，尤其对印度等 underrepresented 人群。

Method: 从FairFD和HAV-DF组印度焦点训练集；用Gemini和ChatGPT构建保留身份测试集（HIDF-img-ip-genai和HIDF-vid-ip-genai）；评估AIDE和Effort检测器在预训练（PT）和微调（FT）下的AUC、AP、EER和准确率。

Result: 微调在域内提升显著（如Effort AUC 0.739→0.944），但在保留身份测试集下降（如AIDE AUC 0.923→0.563），非IP图像PT性能高，显示对IP编辑的特定脆弱性。

Conclusion: 确立IP-AIGC-Indian为具挑战性场景，推动保留表示适应和印度感知基准构建，以弥合泛化差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels. All data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2025 to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成图像成功但推理计算成本高、步数多；以往少步蒸馏需重训学生模型，成本高且泛化差。

Method: 提出阶段感知加速策略，早期的慢去噪阶段用Slow-LoRA（小加速），后期的快去噪阶段用Fast-LoRA（大加速）；仅在基础模型上轻量LoRA适配器，无需重训学生模型。

Result: 在多样基准上实现最高5倍加速，视觉质量相当；LoRA专家仅用1个样本在单V100上1小时内训练，即对未见提示泛化强。

Conclusion: 通过轻量LoRA专家实现高效加速和强泛化，避免了重训成本。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

TL;DR: 本文探讨位元级自回归生成模型中样本多样性挑战，识别二进制建模和尖锐logits分布两大问题，提出DiverseAR方法，通过自适应logits缩放和能量基路径搜索提升多样性并保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位元自回归(AR)生成模型样本多样性不足：(1)二进制分类限制预测空间；(2)logits分布过尖锐导致采样崩溃。

Method: DiverseAR：(1)自适应logits分布缩放机制，动态调整采样时二元输出分布尖锐度，实现更平滑预测和更高多样性；(2)基于能量的生成路径搜索算法，避免低置信token采样，维持视觉保真度。

Result: 广泛实验证实DiverseAR显著提升位元AR图像生成的样本多样性。

Conclusion: DiverseAR是一种原则性、有效的方法，在不牺牲视觉质量前提下增强图像生成多样性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: LoVoRA在无掩码视频物体编辑中表现出色，显著提升编辑质量和一致性。

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Motivation: LiDAR与相机几何精度差异导致以往BEV融合方法性能下降，特别是图像深度估计误差引起的空间不对齐；点云固有稀疏性和语义局限需图像指导弥补。

Conclusion: BEVDilation有效提升3D目标检测性能，验证LiDAR优先融合的优越性，代码开源：https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Conclusion: U4D显著提升4D世界建模可靠性，支持自动感知和仿真应用。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Motivation: 现有DLM推理方法依赖局部即时度量（如置信度或熵），缺乏可靠全局视角，常导致采样轨迹不一致和生成质量次优。

Method: 提出CCD框架：1）轨迹校正机制，利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，早拒绝次优路径（理论上等价于建模上下文与令牌预测的条件互信息）；2）自适应采样策略，根据一致性度量动态调整每个扩散步骤的解掩码预算，而非均匀分配。

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA等基准上，同时提升推理速度和性能，最高达3.48x加速和3.91%性能改进。

Conclusion: CCD显著改善生成轨迹质量并加速采样过程，实现速度与性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Conclusion: MEFT方法有效提升语音模型微调的内存效率和训练速度，为资源受限场景提供可行方案。

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

### [94] [Lightweight Latent Reasoning for Narrative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02240)
*Alexander Gurung,Nikolay Malkin,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LiteReason，一种轻量级潜在推理方法，可与标准令牌采样交错使用，并易于结合RL技术，通过轻量级推理投影模块生成连续潜在令牌，帮助模型“跳过”推理步骤，在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务上减少最终推理长度77-92%，性能接近非潜在RL训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过生成长链推理痕迹来处理复杂任务，使用RL优化这些痕迹以提升答案预测效用，但计算成本高，尤其是叙事任务涉及大量令牌检索和处理。

Method: LiteReason引入轻量级Reasoning Projector模块，训练产生连续潜在令牌以跳过推理步骤；在RL训练中，策略模型决定何时激活投影器，在潜在和离散推理间切换。

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成实验中，优于潜在推理基线，接近非潜在RL训练性能，同时最终推理长度减少77-92%。

Conclusion: LiteReason引导RL训练至性能-计算权衡曲线的更高效部分。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示设计对LLM推理关键，但具体性（详细 vs 模糊）影响未充分研究。

Method: 引入DETAIL框架：用GPT-4生成多级提示，按困惑度量化具体性，用GPT语义等价评估正确性；在30个新型推理任务上测试GPT-4和O3-mini。

Result: 具体性提高准确率，尤其小型模型和程序性任务。

Conclusion: 强调自适应提示策略需求，提供工具数据支持后续研究。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

TL;DR: 本文引入HealthContradict数据集，评估语言模型在冲突生物医学上下文下回答健康问题的推理能力。实验显示，微调生物医学模型不仅依赖预训练知识，还能有效利用正确上下文并抵抗错误上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型如何利用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及冲突上下文对响应的影响。现有医疗QA基准无法充分区分模型的上下文推理能力。

Method: 构建专家验证的HealthContradict数据集（920个实例：健康问题、事实答案、两个矛盾文档）。测试多种提示设置（正确、错误、矛盾上下文），评估模型输出。

Result: HealthContradict比现有基准更能区分模型上下文推理能力。微调生物医学模型在利用正确上下文和抵抗错误上下文方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 微调生物医学语言模型的优势在于预训练参数知识，以及利用正确上下文并抵抗错误上下文的能力。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大语言模型（LLM）作为求解器和验证器的交互作用，涵盖37个模型和9个基准，引入验证器增益指标，发现跨家族验证最有效，后训练减弱自验证但增强跨验证，数学和逻辑任务验证性最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器-验证器研究局限于自验证和同家族模型，鲜有跨家族分析，且后训练对验证效果的影响不明晰，需要系统评估不同模型家族、大小和训练变体的验证性能。

Method: 选取37个跨多个家族、大小及基础/后训练变体的LLM，在9个涵盖逻辑推理、谜题、符号计算、数学、常识、事实回忆和领域知识的基准上评估自验证、同家族验证和跨家族验证；引入并验证“验证器增益”指标，用于预测基于拒绝采样的性能提升；分析指标随模型大小、后训练及数据集验证性的缩放。

Result: 跨家族验证特别有效；后训练降低自改进但强化跨家族改进；数学和逻辑任务显示最高固有验证性；验证器增益和假阳性率随模型大小及后训练的缩放规律明确；数据集验证性差异显著。

Conclusion: 验证器可显著提升LLM性能，尤其跨家族验证；后训练虽削弱自验证但提升异家族协作；数学逻辑任务最易验证，建议优先采用强验证策略优化生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

TL;DR: 评估驱动的研究，比较文本嵌入（如RoBERTa和Mistral）与轻量级数值特征（如时间、粉丝数、验证、点赞）在假新闻检测和病毒传播预测中的表现，使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集。文本内容在假新闻检测中强大，数值特征在计算受限时可行；病毒传播预测更难，对标签构建敏感，非线性结构更具信息性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对在线虚假信息两个实际任务：(i)假新闻检测和(ii)病毒传播预测，在运营环境中需要快速反应，推动评估驱动的研究。

Method: 使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，比较文本嵌入（RoBERTa，控制组Mistral）、轻量级数值特征（时间、粉丝数、验证、点赞）和序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器）。进行维度降维分析（t-SNE和PCA）。

Result: 文本内容是假新闻检测的强判别器，纯数值管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时可行。病毒传播预测比假新闻检测难得多，对标签构建高度敏感；中位数“病毒”划分实用但低估真实世界病毒性，时间截断有益但API限制难实现。t-SNE在数值特征上优于PCA用于病毒传播，非线性结构更具信息性。Mistral嵌入仅带来适度变化。

Conclusion: 讨论评估设计含义，报告真实影响领域的可重复性约束。尽可能发布拆分和代码，提供指标选择指导。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法从早期就混合正负优势信号，可能导致指导模糊、收益有限。

Method: CAPO（Curriculum Advantage Policy Optimization）：基于优势信号的自适应课程，先用正优势样本 bootstrapping 模仿学习建立稳固基础，后渐进引入负信号培养辨别能力；兼容GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++等优化器。

Result: 在数学推理任务中实现稳定显著提升，并有效泛化到多模态GUI推理场景。

Conclusion: CAPO作为通用鲁棒优化框架，提升大模型推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

Motivation: LLM继承并放大预训练语料中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任；现有“编辑”LLM参数以缓解偏见的模型合并方法缺乏实证比较。

Method: 调研七种算法：Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA、Nearswap；应用于GPT、LLaMA、Qwen家族的13个开源模型；使用BBQ、BOLD、HONEST偏见数据集评估偏见，使用SuperGLUE基准评估下游任务性能。

Result: 偏见缓解程度越大，下游性能（尤其是阅读理解、常识和因果推理）下降越明显；Linear、SLERP、Nearswap一致减少偏见并维持性能，SLERP中等权重最优。

Conclusion: 模型合并算法有潜力用于偏见缓解，但需注意过度去偏或不当方法可能损害重要语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

Conclusion: 揭示语言特定护栏局限性，强调开发通用、语言无关的安全系统的重要性，以有效扩展服务全球人口。

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [104] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

*Jiahao Zhao,Shuaixing Zhang,Nan Xu,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入SurveyEval基准，用于全面评估LLM-based自动调查系统在整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考准确性三个维度上的表现，跨7个主题，并通过人类参考增强LLM-as-a-Judge框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based自动调查系统整合检索、组织和内容合成，但评估此类复杂端到端生成管道仍面临重大挑战，现有的工作多关注管道开发而非评估。

Method: 提出SurveyEval综合基准，评估自动生成调查的三个维度：整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考准确性；扩展至7个主题；采用增强的LLM-as-a-Judge框架，结合人类参考以提升评估与人类一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，通用长文本或论文写作系统生成的调查质量较低，而专为调查生成设计的系统能产生显著更高的质量。

Conclusion: 将SurveyEval视为可扩展测试床，用于理解和改进跨不同主题和评估标准的自动调查系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型规模日益增大，全参数微调成本高；众多PEFT方法涌现，但新方法难以复制、部署或相互比较。

Method: 引入PEFT-Factory，一个模块化框架，原生集成19种PEFT方法、27个分类和文本生成数据集（覆盖12项任务），以及标准和PEFT专用评估指标；源于LLaMA-Factory，支持扩展性。

Result: 提供即用型、受控、稳定的环境，大幅提升PEFT方法的 replicability 和基准测试能力。

Conclusion: PEFT-Factory公开可用（https://github.com/kinit-sk/PEFT-Factory），促进PEFT方法的研究与发展。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address the increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, many newly introduced PEFT methods are challenging to replicate, deploy, or compare with one another. To address this, we introduce PEFT-Factory, a unified framework for efficient fine-tuning LLMs using both off-the-shelf and custom PEFT methods. While its modular design supports extensibility, it natively provides a representative set of 19 PEFT methods, 27 classification and text generation datasets addressing 12 tasks, and both standard and PEFT-specific evaluation metrics. As a result, PEFT-Factory provides a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment, improving replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods. PEFT-Factory is a downstream framework that originates from the popular LLaMA-Factory, and is publicly available at https://github.com/kinit-sk/PEFT-Factory

TL;DR: UniFact提出统一评估框架，桥接LLM幻觉检测的模型中心HD与文本中心FV范式，通过大规模实验揭示两者互补，混合方法性能最佳，并呼吁整合研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM易产生幻觉，破坏信任；HD与FV虽同目标但孤立发展，使用不同假设、数据集和协议，导致研究分裂，阻碍进步，需要桥接统一。

Method: 引入UniFact框架，动态生成模型输出及事实标签，实现FV与HD实例级直接比较；在大规模实验中覆盖多LLM家族和检测方法，并分析分歧原因。

Result: 1) 无范式普遍优越；2) HD与FV捕捉事实错误互补方面；3) 整合两者方法 consistently 达SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提供HD与FV分歧深入分析及统一必要性实证；开源代码数据，推动LLM幻觉检测与事实验证统一研究议程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GREC系统在训练与评估域间的分布偏移下表现不佳，且对话 grounding 标注数据稀缺。

Method: 三层数据合成方法，平衡真实性和可控性，生成对话条件 grounding 的可扩展监督数据。

Result: 在合成数据上微调，实现标准评估指标上相对于先前方法的持续、显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决数据稀缺问题，提升GREC系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出TriLex三阶段检索增强框架，用于低资源非洲语言情感词典扩展，提升AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa在南非语言情感分析中的性能，AfroXLMR F1超80%，优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，导致词典覆盖率低和多语言NLP系统性能差。

Method: TriLex框架：(1)基于语料库的情感词提取；(2)跨语言映射；(3)RAG驱动词典精炼。使用扩展词典评估AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa在isiXhosa、isiZulu等语言上的性能，并比较基线和集成方法。

Result: AfroXLMR在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超80%，跨语言稳定性强；AfriBERTa达64%，两者均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析提升精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TriLex是可扩展有效框架，用于多语言情感词典扩展和低资源南非语言情感建模。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出stable rank，一种从LLM隐藏状态中提取的无标注质量信号，用于评估生成质量并指导对齐；引入SR-GRPO方法，实现无外部监督的强化学习对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM偏好对齐依赖外部监督，但存在标注稀缺、主观性、奖励模型易被hack以及自评估偏置等问题，需要内在、稳定的质量信号。

Method: Stable rank通过总方差与主导方向方差之比衡量隐藏状态的有效维度；应用于Best-of-N采样，并开发SR-GRPO算法，将stable rank作为RL奖励信号优化策略。

Result: Stable rank在RewardBench达84.04%准确率，Best-of-N采样平均提升任务准确率11.3%；SR-GRPO在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上STEM任务提升10%、数学推理提升19%，优于奖励模型和自评估基线。

Conclusion: 模型内部表示几何可提取质量信号，实现无外部监督的可扩展对齐路径。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Result: 在15个通用和中医领域主流LLM上的实验验证了TCM-BEST4SDT的有效性。

Conclusion: 为推动智能中医研究发展，TCM-BEST4SDT现已公开发布。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Conclusion: 该系统保留原始内容完整性，并开源Slide Translation代码（GitHub）和集成到Lecture Translator中（MIT许可）。

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

To address this, we introduce promptolution, a unified and modular open-source framework that provides all components required for prompt optimization within a single extensible system for both practitioners and researchers. It integrates multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers while remaining agnostic to the underlying LLM implementation.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言Bangla缺乏足够仇恨言论数据集，正字法异质性和语言多样性导致识别困难；社交媒体平台需自动审核，但Bangla计算资源严重不足。

Method: 复现官方基线（Majority、Random、SVM），新增Logistic Regression、Random Forest、Decision Tree；采用DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT、XLM-RoBERTa等Transformer模型进行Subtask 1A和1B分类。

Result: Transformer模型整体优于基线（DistilBERT除外）；BanglaBERT在两子任务中性能最佳，虽模型较小但胜过m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa。

Conclusion: 语言特定预训练对低资源Bangla仇恨言论检测至关重要，凸显此类预训练模型的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource lan- guages remains a difficult problem due to in- sufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language- specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre- trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

TL;DR: SchED是一种无训练、模型无关的早期退出算法，通过聚合全跨度logit边距并在满足平滑、进度相关的置信阈值时停止解码，加速扩散大语言模型（dLLM）的采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLM）是自回归模型的有力替代，但迭代采样速度慢，严重限制其实用性。

Method: SchED聚合全跨度logit边距，在满足平滑、进度相关的置信阈值时停止解码；无需训练，模型无关。

Result: 在指令微调模型上，实现3.8-4.0倍加速，同时保留99.8-100%的基线性能；在基础模型上，性能保留99.1-100%，激进设置下达2.34倍；使用QPS（γ=4）指标优于先前置信早期退出方法；熵分析显示指令微调加速预测熵衰减。

Conclusion: SchED将真实的置信稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码大幅更高效。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

Conclusion: 通过可视知识图谱和结构化反馈循环，实现人类参与的工作流，持续增强模型可靠性和响应质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MoCoP，一个无数据集、闭环框架，用于持续评估LLM的道德一致性，通过词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和推理判断建模，自生成伦理场景并精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM快速发展需道德一致性，现存对齐框架依赖静态数据集，无法洞察跨上下文或时序的伦理推理演变。

Method: MoCoP结合三层支持：(i)词汇完整性分析，(ii)语义风险估计，(iii)基于推理的判断建模；在自维持架构中自主生成、评估和精炼伦理场景，无需外部监督。

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上实证：捕捉纵向伦理行为，伦理与毒性维度强负相关(rET=-0.81, p<0.001)，与响应延迟近零相关(rEL≈0)。

Conclusion: 道德连贯性和语言安全为模型行为的稳定特征；MoCoP重构伦理评估为动态模型无关的道德内省，提供可复现基础，支持可扩展连续审计，推动自主AI计算道德研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM与形式验证结合的方法缺乏理论基础，细化过程不稳定，可能循环或发散，无法可靠扩展软件验证至手动工作流之外，尤其在安全关键环境中需要可预测性和性能预算。

Method: 将LLM-Verifier交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，引入错误减少概率δ。证明达到“已验证”状态几乎处处终止，且期望迭代步数上界为4/δ。随后进行超过90,000次试验的实证验证。

Result: 所有试验均成功收敛，收敛因子Cf≈1.0，与理论预测高度一致。确立三种操作区：边缘区（marginal）、实用区（practical）和高性能区（high-performance），提供设计阈值。

Conclusion: 理论保证与实验证据相结合，为LLM辅助验证提供清晰架构基础。工程师可实现可预测资源规划和性能预算，适用于安全关键软件部署，无需启发式调优。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

Motivation: MR通过学习动态方程实现MCAS的安全可解释决策，但NODE迭代求解在FPGA上效率低，内存和能耗高，阻碍实时边缘部署。

Method: 提出MERINDA框架，用等价并行神经架构替换NODE迭代求解器，实现FPGA加速MR。

Result: 相比移动GPU，DRAM使用降低近11倍，运行时间加速2.2倍；实验揭示固定精度下内存与能耗反比关系。

Conclusion: MERINDA适用于资源受限的实时MCAS，显著降低内存和能耗。

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGuard is the first family of omni-modal guardrails for safeguarding Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) across text, images, videos, and audio, using deliberate reasoning, trained on a 210K-sample dataset, achieving strong performance on 15 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails are limited to unimodal settings and binary classification, lacking robustness for diverse omni-modal inputs and tasks in OLLMs.

Method: Propose OmniGuard with reasoning ability; curate 210K omni-modal safety dataset covering all modalities (unimodal and cross-modal), annotated with structured labels and expert critiques via distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks demonstrate strong effectiveness and generalization across multimodal safety scenarios.

Conclusion: OmniGuard offers a unified framework to enforce policies and mitigate risks in omni-modal settings, advancing robust omni-modal safeguarding systems.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Motivation: 当前VLMs在多视图空间推理中难以保持几何一致性和跨视图一致性，缺乏隔离多视图推理与单视图感知的细粒度基准。

Method: 构建ReMindView-Bench基准，系统变化视图空间模式和查询类型；评估15个VLMs，使用LLM-as-a-judge、自一致性提示、线性探针和熵动态进行显性和隐性阶段分析。

Result: VLMs在单帧感知上表现良好，但跨视图整合时急剧下降；正确与错误轨迹间信息丢失和不确定性分离不佳。

Conclusion: 提供VLMs空间推理的认知基础诊断，揭示多视图空间心理模型的形成、退化和不稳定过程；开源基准与分析代码。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

TL;DR: 监督学习通过合成错误注入无法有效诱导大语言模型的自纠错能力，与强化学习相比失败，主要由于合成错误与实际在线错误的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习虽主导大语言模型的推理与自纠错，但计算成本高，激发探索自主驾驶与机器人技术启发的监督学习替代方案。

Method: 在推理链中插入人工错误、掩码它们，并通过监督训练模型识别和纠正这些错误。

Result: 该方法即使在简单合成任务上也未能显著提升多模型性能；模型捕获错误时常重复原错误；合成错误到在线错误的分布偏移显著降低纠错能力，即使合成覆盖良好。

Conclusion: 结果解释了为何在线策略强化学习在诱导自纠错方面独特有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

TL;DR: R-Few是一个引导的自博弈挑战者-求解者框架，通过轻量人类监督（上下文 grounding 和混合训练）实现AI模型稳定自进化，避免概念漂移、多样性崩溃等问题，在数学和推理基准上取得显著迭代改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI自进化常因概念漂移、多样性崩溃和误进化导致性能 plateau 或退化，强化自身偏置并趋向低熵行为；需实现稳定、可控自进化，同时最小化人类监督依赖。

Method: 提出R-Few框架：Challenger采样少量人类标注样本引导合成问题生成；Solver在人类和合成样本上联合训练，采用在线难度课程。每迭代进行，融入上下文 grounding 和混合训练。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准上实现一致迭代改进，例如Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上较R-Zero提升+3.0分，性能媲美用20倍人类数据训练的General-Reasoner；消融确认 grounded challenger 和 curriculum solver 的互补贡献。

Conclusion: R-Few缓解漂移，实现更稳定、可控的协同进化动态，证实其有效性。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIS预后预测指导临床决策，但非结构化临床笔记难以用于传统模型，需要利用丰富上下文信息的轻量级框架。

Method: COPE采用两步CoT框架：第一步LLaMA-3-8B生成临床推理，第二步输出mRS预测；在464名AIS患者数据上，与GPT-4、ClinicalBERT、Clinical ML和单步LLM比较，使用MAE、±1准确率和精确准确率评估。

Result: COPE的MAE为1.01（95%CI 0.92-1.11），±1准确率74.4%，精确准确率32.8%，与GPT-4相当，优于其他基线；亚组分析显示在性别、年龄一致，老年、血栓切除术和长摘要患者误差稍高。

Conclusion: COPE是一个轻量级、可解释、隐私保护的开源框架，为从非结构化临床文本预测预后提供准确实用解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Conclusion: TACDA显著提升跨域RUL预测性能，代码开源于GitHub。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLM）在递归推理任务中表现出色，但难以实现深度泛化，即处理训练中未见过的更深嵌套层次。本文揭示Transformer在深度递归上的局限，并提出循环定位-替换管道，在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑中有效缓解OOD深度性能衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽在诸多任务中强大，但在处理嵌套层次结构（如括号嵌套或逻辑子句）的递归推理问题上，面临深度泛化挑战。此前研究聚焦长度泛化，本文首次系统探讨深度泛化局限，揭示其源于Transformer无法维持栈式跟踪多层依赖，导致深度增加时性能急剧衰减。

Method: 提出循环“定位-替换”管道，将递归问题分解为可管理子组件：定位器（locator）识别可解子表达式，替换器（replacer）评估这些组件并保留整体结构。在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑三个可控深度领域评估。

Result: 标准Transformer在更深递归上性能快速衰减，即使序列长度相似。该方法在分布外深度测试中显著缓解衰减，提升LLM在三领域深度泛化能力。

Conclusion: Transformer架构固有缺乏栈行为，无法处理深递归；通过分解子问题，循环定位-替换管道有效克服深度泛化瓶颈，为LLM递归推理提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StockMem事件反思双层记忆框架，用于股票价格预测，通过结构化新闻事件、横向整合与纵向追踪构建时序事件知识库和反思知识库，实现类似历史场景检索与可解释推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测因市场波动性和对实时事件的敏感性而具挑战性；大语言模型（LLMs）虽适用于文本预测，但受新闻数据噪声和文本中缺乏明确答案影响；通用记忆架构难以识别价格变动关键驱动因素。

Method: StockMem框架将新闻结构化为事件，按两个维度挖掘：横向整合每日事件，纵向追踪事件演化提取反映市场预期差异的增量信息，构建时序事件知识库；分析事件-价格动态形成反思知识库（因果经验）；预测时检索类似历史场景，并结合当前事件、增量数据与过去经验进行推理。

Result: 实验显示StockMem优于现有记忆架构，提供更优异、可解释推理，通过追溯影响价格的信息链提升决策透明度。

Conclusion: StockMem通过事件驱动的记忆机制，提升金融预测的可解释性和准确性，促进决策透明。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Motivation: 审计师依赖日志条目测试（JETs）检测税务相关账簿异常，但规则方法产生大量假阳性且难以捕捉细微违规，因此调查LLMs作为双式记账异常检测器的潜力。

Method: 在合成和真实世界匿名账簿上基准测试SOTA LLMs（如LLaMA和Gemma），并与传统JETs和机器学习基线比较。

Result: LLMs持续优于传统规则JETs和经典ML基线，同时提供自然语言解释增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果突显AI增强审计的潜力，即人类审计师与基础模型协作以加强财务完整性。

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

TL;DR: 提出SSGPF框架，使用MLLM处理多模态事件提取（MEE），解决复杂结构建模和数据对齐问题。通过弱对齐数据集和LoRA微调LLaVA，在M2E2基准上显著超越SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MEE工作面临两大挑战：（1）缺乏处理复杂多媒体事件结构的有效框架；（2）缺少多模态对齐训练数据，无法有效知识迁移。

Method: 设计逐步模式引导提示框架（SSGPF）：ETSGP用于事件检测，ARSGP（含多步提示和文本桥接 grounding）用于论元提取。基于单模态标注构建弱对齐多模态数据集，在LLaVA-v1.5-7B上用LoRA进行参数高效指令微调。

Result: 在M2E2基准上，事件检测F1提升5.8%，论元提取F1提升8.4%，显著优于SOTA基线。

Conclusion: SSGPF有效解决了MEE挑战，实验证明其优越性。

Abstract: Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) has become an important task in information extraction research as news today increasingly prefers to contain multimedia content. Current MEE works mainly face two challenges: (1) Inadequate extraction framework modeling for handling complex and flexible multimedia event structure; (2) The absence of multimodal-aligned training data for effective knowledge transfer to MEE task. In this work, we propose a Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework (SSGPF) using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as backbone for adaptive structure capturing to solve MEE task. At the initial step of SSGPF, we design Event Type Schema Guided Prompting (ETSGP) for event detection, then we devise Argument Role Schema Guided Prompting (ARSGP) that contains multi-step prompts with text-bridged grounding technique for argument extraction. We construct a weakly-aligned multimodal event labeled dataset based on existing unimodal event annotations, then conduct parameter efficient instruction tuning with LoRA on LLaVA-v1.5-7B under SSGPF. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate that SSGPF significantly outperforms current SOTA baselines by 5.8 percent F1 on event detection and 8.4 percent F1 on argument extraction.
