In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86NP_TMcode\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eT\u77e9\u9635\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u5438\u6536\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "T\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7403\u5f62\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c92\u5b50\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9879\u76ee\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9T\u77e9\u9635\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "NP_TMcode\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "NP_TMcode\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86T\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u5438\u6536\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u884c\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u6781\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u6ed1\u7c92\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08SPH\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u529b\u8f6f\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u7236\u8282\u70b9\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b80\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u5316\u957f\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u6781\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f6f\u5316\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSPH\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u529b\u8f6f\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6811\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7236\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u8282\u70b9-\u8282\u70b9\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u6811\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u6811\u6253\u5f00\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u5316\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u5316\u6838\u5185\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee5\u6210\u5bf9\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u6781\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u529b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53cc\u661f\u805a\u53d8\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4f4d\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u6781\u65b9\u6cd5\u73b0\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSPH\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u529b\u8f6f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology remain challenging, particularly in low-data regimes, due to complex forward operators and the frequent lack of well-motivated priors for non-Gaussian signals. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes.

Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space.

To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u5f62\u6001\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6001\u7531\u65cb\u8f6c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u6e4d\u6d41\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9610\u660e\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u5f62\u6001\u968f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ea2\u79fb\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u53d8\u9661\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6001\u53d7\u65cb\u8f6c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u6e4d\u6d41\u5728\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u652f\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u661f\u7cfb\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u76d8\u5f62\u6210\u524d\u540e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTNG50\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u76d8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u968f\u7ea2\u79fb\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u661f\u7cfb\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u53d8\u9661\u662f\u76d8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u52bf\u52a0\u6df1\u548c\u70ed\u6c14\u4f53\u6655\u5f62\u6210\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6e4d\u6d41\u5411\u51b7\u76d8\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the spectral fidelity of the smooth foreground continuum, thereby limiting the dynamic range and potentially precluding the detection of the cosmic line signal. In light of this challenge, recent work has proposed using the calibration-independent closure phase to search for the spectral fluctuations of the cosmic 21 cm signal. However, so far there has been only a heuristic understanding of how closure phases map to the cosmological 21 cm power spectrum. This work aims to establish a more accurate mathematical relationship between closure phases and the cosmological power spectrum of the background line signal. Building on previous work, we treat the cosmic signal component as a perturbation to the closure phase and use a delay spectrum approach to estimate its power. We establish the relationship between this estimate and the cosmological power spectrum using standard Fourier transform techniques and validate it using simulated HERA observations. We find that, statistically, the power spectrum estimate from closure phases is approximately equal to the cosmological power spectrum convolved with a foreground-dependent window function, provided that the signal-to-foreground ratio is small. Compared with standard approaches, the foreground dependence of the window function results in an increased amount of mode-mixing and a more pronounced proliferation of foreground power along the line-of-sight dimension of the cylindrical power spectrum. These effects can be mitigated by flagging instances where the window function is broad. Crucial to gaining the necessary sensitivity, this mapping will allow us to average the measurements of closure triads of different shapes based on their imprint in cylindrical Fourier space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b9921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u524d\u666f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a97\u51fd\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u524d\u666f\u529f\u7387\u6cbf\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5149\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b9921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u6765\u641c\u7d22\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u5176\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5b87\u5b99\u4fe1\u53f7\u89c6\u4e3a\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u5fae\u6270\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u6280\u672f\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62dfHERA\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u6bd4\u503c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a97\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u3002\u7a97\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u524d\u666f\u529f\u7387\u6cbf\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u95ed\u9501\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b9921\u5398\u7c73\u4fe1\u53f7\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bb0\u7a97\u51fd\u6570\u8f83\u5bbd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u72b6\u95ed\u9501\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale \u039bCDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u5185\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u039bCDM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5206\u5e03\uff08NFW\u3001Einasto\u3001Burkert\u548cpISO\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GARCIA\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6655\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u6697\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf-\u5149\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u9661\u5ced\u5185\u5cf0\uff09\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5e73\u5766\u6838\u5fc3\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u2018\u5cf0\u6838\u95ee\u9898\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GARCIA\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u768411\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528MCMC\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u6052\u661f\u8d21\u732e\u901a\u8fc7MGE\u548cJAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceHI+He\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f97\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u62df\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6697\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf-\u5149\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aNFW\u6700\u62df\u5408\u5185\u533a\uff0c\u5916\u533a\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8d8b\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u9700\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5cf0\u6838\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eNFW\u5728\u5185\u533a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

Using a primary transit from Spitzer to constrain the system parameters, we tentatively detect an eclipse centered at $BJD=2458740.848893^{+0.00010}_{-0.000099}$ with an observed depth of $171\\pm{29}$ ppm given an uninformed prior. This corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of $T=1031\\pm{58}$ K, which exceeds the calculated equilibrium temperature of $606\\pm{19}$ K. We explore some possible explanations for these results, including inefficient heat redistribution, gravitational contraction, stellar pulsations, instrument systematics and choice of eclipse depth prior, but find none of these to be likely explanations for the observed eclipse parameters. We also explore the impact of correlated noise in the systematic trends, and we find that splitting the systematics into low-pass (smoothing) and high-pass trends is required to reach an optimal minimization of the low-frequency systematics in the resulting detrended light curve.

Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation. Finally, we apply diffHOD-IA in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis and compare its performance with halotools-IA and a neural-network-based emulator, IAEmu.

By matching X-ray, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich, optical and lensing observables to simulations, the ICM-SHOX pipeline indicates that MACS J0018.5+1626 is undergoing a binary merger close to pericenter passage and is observed along a line of sight nearly aligned with the merger axis. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary cluster mergers coupled to tracer particles and a Fokker--Planck solver to model the radio emission. Exploring variations in the most likely initial conditions within the ICM-SHOX parameter space, such as the relative cluster velocity and impact parameter, we find that the resulting merger configuration consistently produces two merger-driven shocks with typical average Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}_s \\sim 2$--$3$ with corresponding standard deviations of $\u03c3_{\\mathcal{M}} \\sim 0.5$--$1.5$.

We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate.

However, despite the recent progress in modelling their population, some of their observed properties are not entirely understood. Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Galaxy clustering is sensitive to $f_{\\textrm{NL}}$ at large scale modes and the next generation of galaxy surveys will approach a statistical error of $\u03c3_{f_{\\textrm{NL}}}\\sim1$. However, the systematic errors on these constraints are dominated by the degeneracy of $f_{\\textrm{NL}}$ with the galaxy bias parameters $b_1$ (galaxy overdensities caused by mass perturbations) and $b_\u03c6$ (galaxy overdensities caused by primordial potential perturbations). It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_\u03c6(z)=2\u03b4_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_\u03c6$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_\u03c6$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_\u03c6(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_\u03c6$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u539f\u521d\u80fd\u91cf\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u53c2\u6570$f_{\\textrm{NL}}$\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570$b_1$\u548c$b_\u03c6$\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CAMELS-SAM\u7ba1\u7ebf\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9$b_\u03c6$\u548c$b_1$\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SC-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e$b_1$\u548c$b_\u03c6$\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3$f_{\\textrm{NL}}$\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570$b_1$\u548c$b_\u03c6$\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u661f\u7cfb\u5de1\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CAMELS-SAM\u7ba1\u7ebf\u8fd0\u884c55\u4e2aSC-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u7684N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff08$L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc\uff0c$N=1280^3$\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf$b_\u03c6$\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e$b_1$\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SC-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u548c\u6bd4\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u4e0e\u6697\u6655\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e$b_1$\u548c$b_\u03c6$\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14sSFR\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-SAM\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u5982IllustrisTNG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684$b_\u03c6$\u884c\u4e3a\uff0csSFR\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u661f\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline.

Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare.

Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u641c\u5bfb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\uff08b_i\uff09\u5f84\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b87\u5b99\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5176\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d7\u7a7a\u6d1e\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u641c\u5bfb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u7a7a\u6d1e\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08sparkling\u3001zobov\u3001revolver\u3001popcorn\uff09\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff08TNG300-1\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u968f\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u5256\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8d1f\u504f\u7f6e\u68af\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u597db_i<0\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u6c34\u5cad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u504f\u7f6e\u8fb9\u754c\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u3002popcorn\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b5b\u9009\u53cd\u504f\u7f6e\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7eaf\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u6d1e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u661f\u7cfb\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002popcorn\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u53cd\u504f\u7f6e\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Here, we report on a multi-band study of a radio quasar B3 1239+376 with $z$ = 3.82. By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$\u03c3$) $\u03b3$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $\u03b3$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $\u03b3$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time. The temporal coincidence establishes a firm association relationship between the $\u03b3$-ray source and the quasar.

Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9MUSE M3G\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u768425\u9897\u9ad8\u4eae\u5ea6\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BCG\u548c\u975eBCG\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fBCG\u548c\u975eBCG\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MUSE\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4b25\u9897Ks\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4eae\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e-25.7\u7b49\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u56fe\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "BCG\u663e\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u65cb\u8f6c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u975e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u975eBCG\u4e2d\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u661f\u7cfb\uff1b\u6162\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "BCG\u4e0e\u975eBCG\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u53d7\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Such ejections can increase their orbital eccentricity, providing significant tidal heating in the absence of any stellar energy source. Previous studies suggested that liquid water could exist on such moons under thick CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres, but these models faced challenges with CO$_2$ condensation and atmospheric collapse, particularly in the high-pressure regimes that favoured long-term habitability. To address this, we employ a self-consistent model, including radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry with condensation, to simulate a more stable hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for a range of initial chemical compositions, including C, O, and N. We find that such atmospheres can effectively trap heat via collision-induced absorption of H$_2$, maintaining surface temperatures suitable for liquid water for time-scales of up to 4.3 Gyr, depending on the surface pressure, while not prone to condensation-induced collapse.

The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We present MESS, a fully automated algorithm for identifying and characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) in large databases of multi-epoch spectra. MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution.

In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope.

We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core.

The $\u03b3$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\u03b3$-rays at $\\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\u03b3$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components.

The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways.\n  Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners & Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics.\n  Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology.\n  Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs.\n  Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective.

Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism.

Appendix: 7 pages", "summary": "ALMA continuum measurements of the local ULIRG IRAS 07251-0248 E at 667$\u03bc$m reveal an extremely compact (R < 27 pc) and bright ($T_B$ >200 K) nucleus with an absorbing foreground envelope and a surrounding (R ~ 75 pc) disk or torus seen nearly face-on. The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($\u03c4_{667\u03bcm}$ >0.5, corresponding to $N_H > 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at >500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $\u03bc$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the \"greenhouse\" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $\u03a3_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $\u03c4_{100 \u03bcm}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALMA\u548cJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u63ed\u793aIRAS 07251-0248 E\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u660e\u4eae\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u7684AGN\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u5b58\u5728\u539a\u76d8\u6216\u73af\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76IRAS 07251-0248 E\u7684\u6838\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9ad8\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e0e\u906e\u853dAGN\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408ALMA\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u548cJWST\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6838\u533a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u533a\u5149\u5ea6\u4e3a10^12 Lsun\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u5149\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a5e8 Lsun pc^-2\uff1b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\u663e\u793a\u5916\u6d41\u548c\u76d8/\u73af\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "IRAS 07251-0248 E\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6838\u533a\uff08CON\uff09\uff0cAGN\u4eae\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5916\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u70ed\u6ce1\u9a71\u52a8\u3002"}}

However, despite recent progress in radio interferometric imaging spectroscopy, current instruments still face limitations in image fidelity and resolution, restricting detailed spectroscopic studies of flaring regions. Here we present high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy of a M1.3 GOES class flare with MeerKAT, a precursor to the future-generation array SKA-Mid. Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons.

In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $\u03c3(B_0)\\simeq 2.27\\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $\u03c3(B_0)\\simeq 6.37\\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$.

Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of \"hard-sphere\" scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets.

In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \\lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions.

In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey.

Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior.

Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed.

We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\\rm PBH}\\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\\rm -}10^{-1})$.

In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \u03b1systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \u03b1, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\u03b1$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u7684BH\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5438\u79ef\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u53ca\u529b\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u4e86BHL\u5438\u79ef\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u03b1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65cb\u8f6c\u5d4c\u5165\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5d4c\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u529b\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76BHL\u5438\u79ef\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u03b1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5d4c\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u03b1\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6fc0\u6ce2\u9525\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u548cQPO\u9891\u7387\uff1bBH\u81ea\u65cb\u6291\u5236\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u632f\u8361\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u03b1\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891QPO\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u5d4c\u5165BH\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u03b1\u662f\u8c03\u8282\u5438\u79ef\u5f62\u6001\u548cQPO\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \\sim 10^{6}\\,M_\\odot$, formed at $z\\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_\u03c1\\gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean.

This pulsar is known to orbit a compact high-mass companion with a period of 3.98\\,hrs in a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.085$).

The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u72b6\u661f\u4e91Abell 30\u5185\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7535\u79bb\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u6e4d\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u51fb\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u55b7\u5c04\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Abell 30\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5316\u5b66\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3001\u6e4d\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528William Herschel\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4e0a\u7684INTEGRAL\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u79ef\u5206\u573a\u5355\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8282\u70b9J1-J4\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u5b66\u590d\u5408\u7ebf\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u6fc0\u53d1\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0ORLs\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6781\u5730\u533a\u57df\uff08J1\u3001J3\uff09\uff0cCELs\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8d64\u9053\u533a\u57df\uff08J2\u3001J4\uff09\uff1b[O III]\u7ebf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51b7\u6838\uff0815000 K\uff09\u548c\u70ed\u5916\u5c42\uff0820000 K\uff09\uff1b\u901f\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u56de\u65cb\u901f\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u660e\u6781\u7aef\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "Abell 30\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u55b7\u5c04\u5386\u53f2\u5728\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $\u03a9_{DE}=\u03a9_\u039b+\u03a9_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $\u03a9_\u039b$ and the scalar field energy $\u03a9_{x}$. Provided that $\u03a9_{DE}\\approx 0.7$, negative values of $\u03a9_\u039b$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $\u039bCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\\gtrsim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ observed at $z\\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $\u03a9_\u039b$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\\sim 10^2\\,M_{\\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $\u03a9_\u039b\\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d1f\u03a9_\u039b\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08BHs\uff09\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u91caJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684z>10\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u548cz\u22738\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08M_BH\u227310^7M\u2299\uff09\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8d1f\u03a9_\u039b\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u9ed1\u6d1e\u901a\u8fc7\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6781\u9650\u5438\u79ef\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a10^2M\u2299\uff0c\u5c06\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u7684\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6700\u5927\u589e\u957f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03a9_\u039b\u2248-1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u4eae\u661f\u7cfb\u548cAGN\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1f\u03a9_\u039b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u89e3\u91caJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65e9\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

For the past $5-6~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u9a6c\u5ea7\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08Sgr\uff09\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u7a7f\u8fc7\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u9762\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u51b2\u51fb\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u9762\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u3001\u76d8\u9762\u6ce2\u7eb9\u3001\u76f8\u87ba\u65cb\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf-\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6ce2\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u6790\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u3001\u6052\u661f\u68d2\u7b49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5355\u6b21\u76d8\u9762\u7a7f\u8d8a\u51b2\u51fb\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u9a6c\u5ea7\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08Sgr-like\uff09\u5355\u6b21\u76d8\u9762\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f3a\u5927\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\u3001\u76d8\u9762\u6ce2\u7eb9\u3001\u76f8\u87ba\u65cb\u548c$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$\u6ce2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u76d8\u9762\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u591f\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u5c40\u90e8\u76d8\u9762\u6ce2\u7eb9\u548c\u87ba\u65cb\u81c2\uff08\u5982\u5916\u81c2\u3001\u672c\u5730\u81c2\u548c\u4eba\u9a6c-\u8239\u5e95\u81c2\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u663e\u8457\u51b2\u51fb\u53d1\u751f\u5728700-1200 Myr\u524d\u3002$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$\u6ce2\u548c\u76f8\u87ba\u65cb\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "Sgr\u7ea610\u4ebf\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u663e\u8457\u7a7f\u8d8a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u9762\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8bf1\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca$L_{z}-\\bar{V}_{R}$\u6ce2\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u94f6\u6cb3\u68d2\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u536b\u661f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u3002"}}

Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u9ea6\u54f2\u4f26\u4e91\u4e2d\u6c2e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684Wolf-Rayet\uff08WN\uff09\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eOGLE\u3001MACHO\u548cTESS\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u7206\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u9897\u6c2e\u5bcc\u96c6WN\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6052\u661f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528OGLE\u957f\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MACHO\u548cTESS\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8647\u9897\u5355\u9897WN\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u548c\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ea61/3\u661f\u4f53\u9ad8\u53d8\uff0c11\u9897\u8868\u73b0\u51fa2-56\u5929\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c9\u9897\u663e\u793a\u7206\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c6\u9897\u4e3a\u957f\u5468\u671f\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "WN\u6052\u661f\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the CCF of the Z-source GX 349+2 using an XMM-Newton observation. We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer.

Column density maps are derived from 870 $\u03bc$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities.

Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history.

To be submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We test claims of large-scale anisotropy in the local expansion rate using cluster scaling relations as distance indicators. Using a Bayesian forward model, we jointly fit the X-ray luminosity--temperature (LT) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich--temperature (YT) relations, marginalising over the latent cluster distances and modelling selection effects as well as peculiar velocities. The latter are modelled using reconstructions of the local peculiar velocity field where we self-consistently account for possible anisotropic redshift--distance relations via an approximate scheme. This treatment proves crucial to the inferred anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between anisotropy in scaling relation normalisations and underlying cosmological anisotropy. We apply our method to 312 clusters at $z \\lesssim 0.2$, testing dipolar, quadrupolar and general (pixelised) anisotropy models. Bayesian model selection finds no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model.

Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\u03bc$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b4\u98970\u7ea7\u539f\u6052\u661f\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08COMs\uff09\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u53ca\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86COM\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u65e9\u671f\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u6c14\u76f8\u8868\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e6\u53ca\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JWST MIRI MRS\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u5bf94\u98970\u7ea7\u539f\u6052\u661f\uff08IRAS 15398-3359\u3001Ser-emb7\u3001L483\u3001B335\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u548c\u7845\u9178\u76d0\u5438\u6536\u540c\u6b65\u62df\u5408\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u83b7\u5f975-28 \u03bcm\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u51b0\u5c42\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5206\u4e3a\u6c34\u3001\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u3001\u7532\u9187\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u5b50\uff0cCOM\uff08\u5982\u7f9f\u57fa\u80fa\u3001\u7532\u80fa\u7b49\uff09\u5360\u6bd4\u5c0f\uff1b-CH3\u548c-OH\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u591aCOM\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8c31\u5e26\u91cd\u53e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u9274\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86COM\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polarization modes. We find $\\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at 68\\% confidence level, compatible with $M/M_{Pl}\\simeq 0.003$, which is interesting for post-inflationary processes, such as preheating. We conduct a lattice simulation for the inflaton field for the first few e-folds, as the model is compatible with the production of relics such as oscillons, which are possible candidates as sources of gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $y\u03c6\u03c3^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ACT\u6700\u65b0\u5b87\u5b99\u5fae\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff08CMB\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5927\u573a\u5b87\u5b99\u66b4\u80c0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u96f6\u771f\u7a7a\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff08VEV\uff09$M$\u7684\u65b0\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u632f\u8361\u5b50\u7b49\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22ACT\u6700\u65b0CMB\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5927\u573a\u66b4\u80c0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dVEV $M$\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u540e\u66b4\u80c0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u9884\u70ed\uff09\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u632f\u8361\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548c\u539f\u521d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5019\u9009\u6e90\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408ACT+Planck\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9ad8\u8c31\u6307\u6570$n_s$\u53caBICEP/Keck Array\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u786e\u7acb$M$\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u66b4\u80c0\u573a\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u632f\u8361\u5b50\u7b49\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u5f97$\u2060\\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$\uff0868%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\uff0c$M/M_{Pl}\\simeq 0.003$\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u632f\u8361\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u632f\u5e45\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5185\u4f46\u9891\u7387\u5728GHz\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f4e$M$\u503c\u53ca\u540e\u66b4\u80c0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdc\u79bb\u9884\u671f\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u8026\u5408\u9879$y\u03c6\u03c3^2$\u5bf9\u9884\u8a00\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at $3 < z < 4$, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new \\textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \\textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \\textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$\u03b1$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "JWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbLy\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u4f53\uff08LAE\uff09\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5408\u5e76LAE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u672a\u89e6\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u661f\u66b4\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u5f15\u8d77\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u548cHST\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbLAE\u5408\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9Ly\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408JWST/NIRCam\u548cHST/ACS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Bagpipes\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684SED\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5408\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u5927\u5408\u5e76\uff1b\u5408\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u89e6\u53d1\u661f\u66b4\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u8d77\u989c\u8272\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u4f53\u518d\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u4e2d\u6027\u6c22\u8986\u76d6\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbLy\u03b1\u5149\u5b50\u9003\u9038\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdLAE\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

The group binding energy is comparable to the energy output from AGN, making it an important factor in mutual evolution. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three dynamically active groups: SDSSTG8102, SDSSTG16393, and SDSSTG28674, which are part of the XMM-Newton Group AGN Project X-GAP sample, a statistically complete sample of 49 galaxy groups. We combine uGMRT 400 MHz observations with 144 MHz LOFAR and XMM-Newton observations to study the radio sources associated with the Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs). The BGGs in SDSSTG8102 and SDSSTG16393 have extended radio emission with asymmetric distortions in their morphologies. SDSSTG28674 has a compact flat-spectrum radio source associated with the BGG and an extended lobe on one side, connected by a faint bridge detected with LOFAR. Integrated spectral indices of the three BGGs are $-0.96\\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG8102), $-1.35\\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG16393), and $-1.6\\pm0.02$ (SDSSTG28674). X-ray images reveal elongated morphologies in all three groups, with SDSSTG28674 showing evidence of a binary merger, while thermodynamical maps highlight temperature variations. In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix. The spectral diversity across the systems reflects different stages of AGN fading governed by duty cycle, source age, and confinement by the hot IGrM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d3b\u8dc3\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u5f62\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0eIGrM\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u4e2dAGN\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u5185\u4ecb\u8d28\uff08IGrM\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u56e0AGN\u80fd\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u675f\u7f1a\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408uGMRT 400 MHz\u3001LOFAR 144 MHz\u548cXMM-Newton\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\uff08SDSSTG8102\u3001SDSSTG16393\u3001SDSSTG28674\uff09\u4e2dBGGs\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u53caX\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2aBGGs\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5ef6\u4f38\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6307\u6570\uff08SDSSTG8102:-0.96\u00b10.09\uff1bSDSSTG16393:-1.35\u00b10.09\uff1bSDSSTG28674:-1.6\u00b10.02\uff09\u3002X\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u5f62\u6001\u62c9\u957f\uff0cSDSSTG28674\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53cc\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53cd\u6620\u4e86AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0eIGrM\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0eAGN\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u3001\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\u5e74\u9f84\u548cIGrM\u9650\u5236\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral \"wiggles\" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological \"downsizing\" trend was already in place by $z\\simeq4$. The slope of our measured relation ($\\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at $0 < z < 3$. We do not observe objects with $\\log_{10}(M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})\\lesssim10.5$ and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 < z < 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $\u03b1$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $>100$ for $R\\simeq1000$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528JWST/NIRSpec\u5bf914\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e2d\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u66f4\u65e9\u5f62\u6210\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u2018downsizing\u2019\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728z\u22484\u65f6\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6052\u661f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\uff083<z<5\uff09\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u2018downsizing\u2019\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9JWST/NIRSpec\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664PSF\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u2018wiggles\u2019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5149\u8c31\u62df\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u2018downsizing\u2019\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728z\u22484\u65f6\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u9ad8\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea2\u79fb\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4ecd\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5149\u8c31\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\\sim 1.4 \\, \u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \\sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \\lesssim 3000\\, \\mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\\sim2000\\, \\mathrm{K} - 4000 \\, \\mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86JWST\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u7ea2\u8272\u5c0f\u70b9\uff08LRDs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2aLRDs\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6c34\u5438\u6536\u5e26\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\uff08<3000 K\uff09\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u6c14\u4f53\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "LRDs\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u6b64\u524d\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u5c18\u57c3\u7ea2\u5316\u6216\u7a20\u5bc6\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528JWST\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684LRDs\u5149\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b58\u57281.4 \u03bcm\u6c34\u5438\u6536\u5e26\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ca\u6210\u5206\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u5438\u6536\u5e26\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86LRDs\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u7a20\u5bc6\u6c14\u4f53\uff08T\u22723000 K\uff09\uff0c\u8d21\u732e20-30%\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\uff1b\u590d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a2000-4000 K\uff0c\u5426\u5b9a\u4e86\u5355\u9ed1\u4f53\u8f90\u5c04\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206LRDs\u7684\u7ea2\u5149\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u662f\u5185\u5728\u6027\u8d28\u800c\u975e\u5c18\u57c3\u7ea2\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8f90\u5c04\u5149\u5ea6\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bca\u65ad\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}
