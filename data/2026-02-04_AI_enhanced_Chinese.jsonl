It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77ee\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u661f\u7cfbWLM\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5916\u56f4\u6c14\u4f53\u53d7\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\uff08IGM\uff09\u7684\u51b2\u538b\u538b\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u51b2\u538b\u538b\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdWLM\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65cb\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5c06WLM\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u6001\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53d7\u51b2\u538b\u538b\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5ef6\u5c55\u76d8\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5ef6\u5c55\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u660e\u663e\u53d7\u51b2\u538b\u538b\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u7d27\u51d1\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u53d7\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u5e94\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$\u03c3$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$\u03c3$, over $0<z<4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $\u03a9_{\\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir.

Machine-readable version of Table 1 provided in ancillary materials", "summary": "Measuring stellar motions at the Milky Way's Galactic center (GC) provides unique insight into the dynamical processes within galactic nuclei. We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are \"locally unbound\" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using the scale factor ansatz $\u03b1(t)=\\left(\\frac\u03b1\u03b7+t^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 \u03b7}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $\u03c7_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours.

They are believed to be the products of stellar mergers, but the exact origin and formation channel remain unclear. We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales.

However, this progress has largely neglected the significant constraints on the interior of Saturn's structure imposed by the observed oscillation frequencies in its rings. Here, we study initial conditions for Saturn's evolution that, after $4.56\\;\\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, give rise to planetary structures admitting oscillation frequencies consistent with those observed via Saturn's ring seismology. Restricting our attention to models without compact rocky cores, we achieve simultaneous good agreement with most observed properties of Saturn at the level of current evolutionary models and with key frequencies in the observed oscillation spectrum. Our preliminary work suggests that Saturn's interior stably stratified region may be moderately less extended ($\\sim 0.4$--$0.5R_{\\rm Sat}$) than previously thought, which is important for reconciling the seismic constraints with evolutionary models. We also tentatively find that the deep helium gradients inferred by previous, static structural modelling of Saturn's ring seismology may not be required to reproduce the observed seismology data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u571f\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u521d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u571f\u661f\u73af\u9707\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u571f\u661f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5c42\u6c26\u68af\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u571f\u661f\u73af\u9707\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u571f\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u65e0\u7d27\u51d1\u5ca9\u77f3\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u571f\u661f46\u4ebf\u5e74\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9707\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u571f\u661f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e3a\u571f\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u76840.4-0.5\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5c42\u6c26\u68af\u5ea6\u672a\u5fc5\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u9707\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u571f\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u53ca\u6c26\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Gaia Data Release 3\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e868\u4e2a\u758f\u6563\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u6781\u9650\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u758f\u6563\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u661f\u56e2\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gaia Data Release 3\u7684\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6d4b\u5149\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408King\u6a21\u578b\u548cPARSEC\u7b49\u9f84\u7ebf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u6781\u9650\u534a\u5f84\u8303\u56f4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a3.07\u81f316.21\u89d2\u5206\u548c9.97\u81f325.97\u89d2\u5206\uff1b\u5e74\u9f84\u8303\u56f4\u57287.95\u81f39.34\u5bf9\u6570\u5e74\uff0c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea60.007\u81f30.015\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb1640\u81f35203\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecb\u4e8e257\u81f31916\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u661f\u56e2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u677e\u5f1b\uff0cNGC 7245\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53cc\u661f\u56e2\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u661f\u56e2\u5747\u5c5e\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8584\u76d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u758f\u6563\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8584\u76d8\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0cNGC 7245\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u56e2\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for \"first-person\" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her \"subjective state\". We advocate a \"Principle of Self-Locating Indifference\" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of \"old evidence\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u201c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u6982\u7387\u201d\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u81ea\u6211\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u539f\u5219\u201d\uff08PSLI\uff09\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u662f\u66f4\u5927\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u662f\u56f0\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5b87\u5b99\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5408\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u201c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u6982\u7387\u201d\u2014\u2014\u5373\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u7387\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u81ea\u6211\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u539f\u5219\u201d\uff08PSLI\uff09\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u662f\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u4e3b\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u77ac\u95f4\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u77ac\u95f4\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u6982\u7387\u201d\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u3002PSLI\u539f\u5219\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u76f4\u89c2\u5408\u7406\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PSLI\u539f\u5219\u548c\u201c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u6982\u7387\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6ce2\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u8111\u3001Hartle\u548cSrednicki\u7684\u5bd3\u8a00\u4ee5\u53ca\u201c\u65e7\u8bc1\u636e\u201d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \\approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\\approx 5 \\times 10^3 M_{\\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\\gtrsim 22 M_{\\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation.

The observation series span 220 nights from 2013 to 2024. During the observation period, the star's brightness varied within the range of V=9-11 mag. The rotation axis of the \"star + accretion disk\" system is tilted at a large angle, so the line of sight intersects the wind region and accreting flows in the star's magnetosphere. Variability in the short-wavelength wing of the Halpha emission line and the profile of the D NaI resonance doublet are analyzed. It is shown that the wind and accretion flows vary on a time scale of approximately 20 days. When the predominant flow direction changes, a time lag is observed: initially, accretion increases, and after two days, absorption in the line-of-sight wind decreases. It is concluded that the spectral line profiles are formed in the magnetospheric accretion flows and the conical wind originating from the boundary of the star's magnetosphere. The time lag is determined by the tilt of the magnetic dipole and the opening angle of the conical wind.

The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to \\b{eta} Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4eceTESS\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u5916\u5f57\u661f\u51cc\u65e5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1TESS\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u7531\u7cfb\u5916\u5f57\u661f\u51cc\u65e5\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4eea\u5668\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d45\u4e14\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u51cc\u65e5\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTESS Sector 1\u6570\u636e\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u72ec\u7acb\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u523032\u540d\u6f5c\u5728\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u03b7 Pictoris\u591a\u6247\u533a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u5fae\u5f31\u4e14\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u5f57\u661f\u51cc\u65e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\u6848\u4f8b\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u591a\u6697\u793a\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) -- a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the ``cosmological scaling factor'', a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the ``unfolding relation'', a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u8584\u5c42\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\uff08MSD\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570$H_0$\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u91cf\u8584\u5c42\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u5316\u53cc\u5e73\u9762MSD\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\"\u5c55\u5f00\u5173\u7cfb\"\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u5bf9\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u900f\u955c\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8584\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u900f\u955c\u5e73\u9762\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u8584\u5c42\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u5bf9\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff08SNe\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\uff08GWs\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4SN\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u8f90\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Prometheus-Vertex\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd12.28 M_sun\u548c18.88 M_sun\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u574d\u7f29\u524d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u53cd\u5f39\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5df2\u77e5\u7684SN\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u540e\u6fc0\u6ce2\u5bf9\u6d41\u3001\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u6d41\u3001\u9a7b\u70b9\u5438\u79ef\u6fc0\u6ce2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u524d\u574d\u7f29\u6d3b\u52a8\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u53ca\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u57281-2000 Hz\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002"}}

In the quiet Sun, the spatially averaged line profile shows a red asymmetry and a redshift of the line center. It is known that the effect of isotopic splitting must be taken into account in the forward modeling to reproduce the observed asymmetry. So far, no numerical model could match an average observed line profile in terms of the line width and asymmetry. Our goal is to investigate how well a simulation computed with the chromospheric extension of the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) reproduces the spatially averaged Ca ii 854.2 nm line profile. We aim to determine the contributions from the isotopic splitting versus the dynamics in the atmosphere to the resulting line width and asymmetry. We solve the radiative transfer problem three times, once considering only the most abundant isotope of calcium in the atmosphere, once taking six calcium isotopes into account, and finally using a single composite atom model. We find the forward modeled spatially and temporally averaged spectra to be in good agreement with an average observation of the quiet Sun. In order to match the observed line width, the simulated atmosphere must be sufficiently dynamic. The typical red asymmetry can only be reproduced by taking the isotopic splitting effect into account, as suggested in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528MURaM-ChE\u6a21\u62df\u592a\u9633\u8272\u7403\u5c42\u7684Ca II 854.2 nm\u8c31\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u8c31\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u6d4b\u7684Ca II 854.2 nm\u8c31\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1MURaM-ChE\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u9499\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u3001\u7eb3\u5165\u516d\u79cd\u9499\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u590d\u5408\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8c31\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8c31\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9700\u8db3\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u800c\u7ea2\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5206\u88c2\u6548\u5e94\u624d\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5206\u88c2\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u91cd\u73b0Ca II 854.2 nm\u8c31\u7ebf\u7ea2\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5bf9\u8c31\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\u03bc$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\\gtrsim$1.5 $\u03bc$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features.

We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the \"synchronized pair\" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\\ast \\sim 10^{8-9}M_\\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \\sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570Little Red Dots\uff08LRDs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u7d2b\u5916\u660e\u4eae\u7684\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5206\u5b50\u6c22\u51b7\u5374\u4fc3\u8fdbLRDs\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LRDs\u6781\u7aef\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7d27\u51d1\u5929\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u6210\u50cf\u5206\u679083\u4e2aLRDs\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cSED\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f34\u661f\u5bf9LRDs\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ea643%-85%\u7684LRDs\u5177\u6709\u7d2b\u5916\u660e\u4eae\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e3a1.0 kpc\u3002Lyman-Werner\u8f90\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b26\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u574d\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u652f\u6301LRDs\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "LRDs\u53ca\u5176\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u51b7\u5374\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7d27\u51d1\u5929\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4e3aJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u55b7\u53d1\uff08QPEs\uff09\u7684\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u8f90\u5c04\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u51fa\u6c14\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u5411\u4e0e\u540e\u5411\u6d41\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "QPEs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u3001\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u77ac\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u55b7\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91caQPEs\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u8f90\u5c04\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6052\u661f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fa\u4f53\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u4e0e\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u78b0\u649e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u78b0\u649e\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u52a0\u70ed\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u629b\u7269\u9762\u7684\u5f13\u6fc0\u6ce2\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u52a0\u70ed\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u6052\u661f\u6b63\u524d\u65b9\u7684\u6c14\u67f1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5411\u4fa7\u9762\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u524d\u5411\u6d41\u51fa\u6bd4\u540e\u5411\u6d41\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u66f4\u591a\u4e14\u4eae\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a\u540e\u5411\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "QPEs\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5f3a\u5f31\u4ea4\u66ff\u55b7\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6d41\u51fa\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u661f\u76d8\u78b0\u649e\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3aQPEs\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e72\u6d89\u672f\uff08intensity interferometry\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea2\u56e2\u7c07\u661f\uff08Red Clump stars\uff09\u7684\u89d2\u76f4\u5f84\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73b0\u6709SBC\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u56e2\u7c07\u661f\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6-\u989c\u8272\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u5927\u9ea6\u54f2\u4f26\u4e91\u76841%\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u5b9a\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u5b66\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u89d2\u76f4\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e72\u6d89\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea2\u56e2\u7c07\u661f\u7684\u89d2\u76f4\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6052\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\u4eae\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002\u4ee5HD 17652\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5728$H$\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0<1%\u7684\u89d2\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e72\u6d89\u672f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ea2\u56e2\u7c07\u661f\u89d2\u76f4\u5f84\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u540c\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ca\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u9635\u5217\u7684\u590d\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u7f29\u77ed\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e72\u6d89\u672f\u4e3a\u7ea2\u56e2\u7c07\u661f\u89d2\u76f4\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7TESS\u5149\u5ea6\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56db\u9897\u65b0\u7684\u51cc\u65e5\u8910\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e09\u9897\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u8d85\u8fc7100\u5929\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4e3b\u661f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e9a\u592a\u9633\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u3001\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u6c99\u6f20\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u957f\u5468\u671f\u51cc\u65e5\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u7f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528TESS\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408FEROS\u548cPLATOSpec\u6444\u8c31\u4eea\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u786e\u8ba4\u8910\u77ee\u661f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u3001\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u548c\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u9897\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\uff0c\u4e3b\u661f\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0e\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e\u8d2b\u4e4f\u5bbf\u4e3b\uff0c\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u5219\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6052\u661f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u8f83\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u788e\u88c2\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5370\u8bb0\uff1b\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u660e\u8910\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u901a\u9053\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u9009\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit.

We find a strong correlation between inferred nickel mass and SALT2 stretch, which within our simplified modelling is linked to larger ejecta masses providing longer diffusion times, providing a physical basis for the brighter-slower relation. SN~Ia in low-mass hosts ($\\log_{10}(M_*/M_\\odot) < 10$) produce $12\\%$ more $^{56}$Ni than those in high-mass hosts ($\u0394M_{\\rm Ni} = 0.13~M_\\odot$), linking the host-galaxy mass step to ejecta properties and hinting at metallicity or age-dependent burning efficiencies. This suggests that standardisation based on physical parameters may remove the mass-step. SN~1991T-like events show higher ejecta masses (median $1.64~M_\\odot$ vs. $1.38~M_\\odot$ for normals) and produce $30\\%$ more $^{56}$Ni, with $84\\%$ having super-Chandrasekhar masses. Through Hierarchical modelling of $902$ SNe ($z \\leq 0.06$), we find thermonuclear supernovae can be well described by a Gaussian distribution in ejecta mass and nickel mass with $\u03bc_{\\rm ej} = 1.26 \\pm 0.01~M_\\odot$ ($\u03c3_{\\rm ej} = 0.33 \\pm 0.01~M_\\odot$) and $\u03bc_{\\rm Ni} = 0.64 \\pm 0.06~M_\\odot$ ($\u03c3_{\\rm Ni} = 0.42 \\pm 0.02~M_\\odot$), respectively.

We use two different inversion methodologies and a model of the tachocline to derive its position, width and the amplitude of the radial shear. To validate our methodology we present results from simulated rotational splittings, whether including or not random noise commensurable with the current observational precision. We also describe how we leverage the fact that one of our methodologies uses an initial guess that can be chosen to include a priori information. In order to try to resolve the tachocline, we increased the radial density of the inversion grid and showed how it affect the inferences. We also show how the trade off between smoothing and noise magnification affects these, as well as the effectiveness of using an informed initial guess. Results derived from high-precision rotational splittings show clearly that the location of the tachocline at low latitudes is different for its position at high latitudes. The latitudinal variation of its width is not significantly constrained, but our results agree with estimates based on forward modeling.

With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets.

Properties and performance of the NISP signal estimator", "comment": null, "summary": "The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u592a\u7a7a\u8239\u4e0a\u7684NISP\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u98de\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1NISP\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e9\u671f\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a99%\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u9635\u5217\u504f\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e0.01 e/s\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5728\u672a\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u65f6\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7b26\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u4fee\u6b63\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Using 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates ($5.0 \\leq z < 6.3$) selected via machine learning from the Legacy Survey Data Release 9 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we perform wide-field clustering analysis to investigate the large-scale environment of those high-redshift quasars. We construct the projected auto correlation function of those high-redshift quasars that is weighted by its predicted probability of being a true high-redshift quasar, from which we derive the bias parameter and the typical dark matter halo mass of those quasars. The dark matter halo mass of quasars estimated from the projected auto correlation function is $\\log(M_h/M_{\\odot})=12.2 ^{+0.2}_{-0.7}$ ($11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$), with the bias parameter $b$ of $12.34 ^{+4.26}_{-4.37}$ ($11.52^{+4.02}_{-4.14}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \\leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \\leq z <6.3$).

III (proto)star at redshift $z \\sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $<100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\\sim 27$ M$_{\\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion.

In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems.

Submitted for publication to A&A", "summary": "Observed cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) exhibit strong variability. In the subcritical luminosity regime, the centroid energy ($E_{CRSF}$) and line width ($\u03c3_{CRSF}$) often show positive correlations with the X-ray luminosity. We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing. The CRSF is systematically redshifted relative to the classical cyclotron energy, with the magnitude of the redshift decreasing at higher luminosities and for larger viewing angles $\u03b8$. Both $E_{CRSF}$ and $\u03c3_{CRSF}$ correlate positively with luminosity for all viewing angles. Their absolute values, however, depend strongly on the viewing angle, indicating substantial variability over the pulse cycle and sensitivity to the system geometry. At fixed luminosity, $E_{CRSF}$ ($\u03c3_{CRSF}$) decreases (increases) with increasing $\\cos\u03b8$. Consequently, phase-resolved observations are expected to reveal an anticorrelation between the CRSF centroid energy and width. When applied to the XRP GX 304$-$1, the model reproduces the observed CRSF variability over nearly an order of magnitude in luminosity for geometries in which the accretion funnel is predominantly viewed edge-on.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff08XRPs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u56de\u65cb\u5171\u632f\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff08CRSFs\uff09\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6d41\u7684\u5171\u632f\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CRSF\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5149\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GX 304\u22121\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0CRSFs\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u754c\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f$E_{CRSF}$\u548c$\u03c3_{CRSF}$\u4e0eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5438\u79ef\u6f0f\u6597\u4e2d\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u5149\u5ea6\u5206\u6790CRSF\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5149\u8c31\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0CRSF\uff0c\u4e14CRSF\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ea2\u79fb\u3002$E_{CRSF}$\u548c$\u03c3_{CRSF}$\u5747\u4e0e\u5149\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u53d7\u89c6\u89d2\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u89d2\u8f83\u5927\u65f6CRSF\u7ea2\u79fb\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "CRSF\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728GX 304\u22121\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u8fa8\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u63ed\u793aCRSF\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\u03bc$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation.

The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\u03c7^2_\\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\\text{rim}\\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\\text{out}\\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\\text{rim,literature}\\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing (~5 au) and short orbit ($P\\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To appear in SPIE Proceedings Vol. 13899", "summary": "Two-photon polymerization (2PP) enables fabrication of high-precision micro-optics with complex freeform geometries, opening a new parameter space for custom astronomical optics. Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728IPX-Clear\u6811\u8102\u5236\u6210\u7684\u5fae\u5149\u5b66\u5143\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u6c89\u79ef\uff08ALD\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5236\u5907\u8349\u72b6\u6c27\u5316\u94dd\u6297\u53cd\u5c04\u6d82\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u83f2\u6d85\u5c14\u53cd\u5c04\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5929\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5fae\u900f\u955c\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u89c2\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfIPX-Clear\u6811\u8102\u5236\u6210\u7684\u5fae\u5149\u5b66\u5143\u4ef6\u56e0\u7a7a\u6c14-\u805a\u5408\u7269\u754c\u9762\u7684\u83f2\u6d85\u5c14\u53cd\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u5149\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8349\u72b6\u6c27\u5316\u94dd\u6d82\u5c42\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57282PP\u5fae\u5149\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u6c89\u79ef\uff08ALD\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728IPX-Clear\u5fae\u900f\u955c\u8868\u9762\u5236\u5907\u8349\u72b6\u6c27\u5316\u94dd\u6297\u53cd\u5c04\u6d82\u5c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6e10\u53d8\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7279\u6027\u6291\u5236\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6d82\u8986\u8349\u72b6\u6c27\u5316\u94dd\u7684\u5fae\u900f\u955c\u5728400-850 nm\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u7ea60.3%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u6d82\u5c42\u65f6\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408IPX-Clear\u7684\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u900f\u955c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1400-1700 nm\u5168\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We take into account the non-linear lens-lens coupling and line of sight effects, the latter treated as external mass sheets with associated shear. If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes.

Leveraging the \\textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, we train emulator models to describe the non-linear clustering of galaxies and velocities in redshift space. Our analysis demonstrates that combining galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering, provides tighter constraints on both HOD and cosmological parameters, particularly on $\u03c3_8$ and $w_0$. We further apply our models to realistic mock catalogues, reproducing the expected density and peculiar velocity errors of type-Ia supernovae and Tully-Fisher/fundamental plane measurements for the combined ZTF and DESI measurements. While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\\%$ precision measurement on $f\u03c3_8$ compared to $4.7\\%$ using galaxy clustering alone.

The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}~M_\\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\\times10^{-10}$, and $4\\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO.

In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\\mathrm{zz,A}\\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\\mathrm{zz,B}\\sim10^{8.2}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\\mathrm{[C/H]}\\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$.

When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$\u03b1$, lower [O III]/H$\u03b2$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators.

We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z<1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the ``tip-of-the-iceberg'' effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z>3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\\sim$several tens ($\\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\uff08GRB\uff09\u7684\u77ac\u53d1\u8f90\u5c04\u6d4b\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6e90\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbGRB\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22GRB\u77ac\u53d1\u8f90\u5c04\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7531\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u964d\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u51b0\u5c71\u4e00\u89d2\u201d\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d626\u4e2a\u7ea2\u79fb$z<1$\u7684\u660e\u4eaeGRB\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Swift/BAT\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbGRB\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u80fd\u91cf\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Swift/BAT\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fbGRB\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u5176\u4e0e\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u51b0\u5c71\u4e00\u89d2\u6548\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\u3002"}}

This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Young transiting exoplanets provide unique opportunities to probe planetary atmospheres during the critical early phases of evolution. HIP~67522~b, a 17~Myr old hot Jupiter with an extraordinarily low bulk density, represents an ideal target for high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to characterize the atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of HIP~67522~b using ground-based high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution spectra with VLT/CRIRES+ in the K2166 band during a transit on 30 January 2025. We applied cross-correlation techniques and Bayesian nested sampling retrievals to constrain molecular abundances, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics. We detect H$_2$O at 20$\u03c3$ and CO at 5$\u03c3$, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of $-2.9 \\pm 0.2$~km~s$^{-1}$ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to $<1.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ at 3$\u03c3$, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 $\\pm$ 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3$\u03c3$ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \\pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H]~$= -0.8 \\pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$\u03c3$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e74\u8f7b\u70ed\u6728\u661fHIP 67522 b\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u6210\u5206\u3001\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230H2O\u548cCO\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u663c\u591c\u98ce\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6c18\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "HIP 67522 b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u9897\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e14\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5176\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u6c14\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLT/CRIRES+\u5728K2166\u6ce2\u6bb5\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5d4c\u5957\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5b50\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u663e\u8457H2O\u548cCO\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663c\u591c\u98ce\u901f\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6c18\u5bcc\u96c6\uff1b\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u548cC/O\u6bd4\u4e0eJWST\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5927\u6c14\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u4e91\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HIP 67522 b\u7684\u4f4e\u91d1\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6c18\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $\u03b1= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars.

Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive.\n  We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations.\n  Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.\n  A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster.\n  Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed.

Typically, AXPs exhibit higher X-ray luminosities, whereas SGRs are generally fainter and display significantly high signal-to-noise ratios only during their outburst phases. In this work, we report the long-term timing evolution of four AXPs: 1E 2259+586, 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, which were regularly monitored with NICER from 2017 to 2024. Over this period, we identify a total of 10 timing events. In addition to one glitch and one anti-glitch in 1E 2259+586 reported in literature, we detect another 8 new timing events: 5 glitches, 2 anti-glitches, and 1 unusual state transition event. Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event. Finally, we study the evolution of the pulse profiles and find that the profiles of 1E 2259+586 and 4U 0142+61 both evolve. This is consistent with the earlier finding that pulse profile evolution is a generic feature of magnetars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff08AXPs\uff09\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8610\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecglitches\u3001anti-glitches\u548c\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8109\u51b2\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AXPs\u548c\u8f6f\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u91cd\u590d\u66b4\uff08SGRs\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u8109\u51b2\u8f6e\u5ed3\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u661f\uff08magnetars\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528NICER\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4ece2017\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u5b9a\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u56db\u4e2aAXPs\uff081E 2259+586\u30014U 0142+61\u30011RXS J170849.0-400910\u548c1E 1841-045\uff09\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ca\u8109\u51b2\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b010\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff085\u4e2aglitches\u30012\u4e2aanti-glitches\u548c1\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d4U 0142+61\u662fanti-glitches\u7684\u9ad8\u53d1\u6e90\uff1b\u8109\u51b2\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6f14\u5316\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u78c1\u661f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8109\u51b2\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6f14\u5316\u662f\u78c1\u661f\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u661f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Based on the calculation of the differential emission measure, we determine the parameters of the post-impulsive flare plasma and conclude that the optically thin coronal plasma may contribute of about 20% to the mm emission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591SOL2022-05-04T08:45\uff08M5.7\uff09\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\uff08mm\uff09\u548c\u6781\u7d2b\u5916\uff08EUV\uff09\u53d1\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4e0eEUV\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7b49\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\uff08\u7ea61 MK\uff09\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u5195\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5bf9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8d21\u732e\u7ea620%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u540e\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u4e2d\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eEUV\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528RT-7.5\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u572893 GHz\u63a2\u6d4b\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408SDO/AIA\u548cGOES\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6EUV\u53d1\u5c04\u53ca\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u540e\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0eEUV\u53d1\u5c04\u589e\u52a0\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u7ea61 MK\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u5195\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5bf9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8d21\u732e\u7ea6\u4e3a20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u5728\u540e\u8109\u51b2\u76f8\u4e0eEUV\u53d1\u5c04\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u5195\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5bf9\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8000\u6591\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect.\n  Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population.\n  Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects.\n  Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales.\n  Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations.

The abstract has been abridged due to the arXiv's character limit", "summary": "Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\\rm H\u03b1+ [NII]\u03bb6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\u03c3(|v_{pec}|)_\\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\\ \u03c3_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\u03a3_\\mathrm{SFR} - \u03a3_\\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\u03a3_\\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528SAMI\u661f\u7cfb\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u79bb\u6c14\u4f53\u5f62\u6001\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u4e868\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u53d7\u6216\u8fd1\u671f\u53d7\u5265\u79bb\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\uff0c\u4e14RPS\u5019\u9009\u661f\u7cfb\u7684rSFMS\u5173\u7cfb\u66f4\u9661\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u5728\u5916\u56f4\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9010\u6e10\u4ece\u5916\u5230\u5185\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5265\u79bb\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528SAMI Galaxy Survey\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u4e3a\u672a\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u5c04\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u661f\u7cfb\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u5f25\u6563\u8f83\u5927\uff1bRPS\u5019\u9009\u661f\u7cfb\u7684rSFMS\u5173\u7cfb\u66f4\u9661\uff0c\u5916\u56f4\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "RPS\u4f5c\u7528\u5448\u73b0\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u672a\u6270\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u521a\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94RPS\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u540e\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u5916\u5230\u5185\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems.

Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6c26\u4e09\u91cd\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u9003\u9038\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecNIGHT\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u548cANTARESS\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caEvE\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u661f\u4e0e\u5927\u6c14\u76843D\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u9003\u9038\u5bf9\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u8c37\u548c\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u6c99\u6f20\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1NIGHT\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u548cANTARESS\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EvE\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u76843D\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u4ece\u6d4b\u91cf\u5230\u89e3\u91ca\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u9003\u9038\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6210\u4e3aNCCR PlanetS\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\\odot}$ of gas in $\\sim 2 \\times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\\sim 3.5$ $\u03bc$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\\gtrsim 50$ $\u03bc$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities.

We focus on the high-latitude mode with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and the equatorial Rossby modes with $3 \\le m \\le 16$. We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002--2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e862002-2024\u5e74\u95f4\u592a\u9633\u60ef\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u592a\u9633\u9ed1\u5b50\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u592a\u9633\u60ef\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9891\u7387\u548c\u529f\u7387\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GONG\u548cSDO/HMI\u7684\u73af\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u65e5\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u6d41\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7eac\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08m=1\uff09\u548c\u8d64\u9053Rossby\u6a21\u5f0f\uff083 \u2264 m \u2264 16\uff09\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u56db\u5e74\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u6bcf\u516d\u4e2a\u6708\u66f4\u65b0\u4e00\u6b21\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5e45\u5ea6\u968fm\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u6a21\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u666e\u904d\u8d85\u8fc7100%\u3002\u9ad8\u7eac\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u9ed1\u5b50\u6570\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u8d64\u9053Rossby\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u9ed1\u5b50\u6570\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u529f\u7387\u591a\u6570\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46m=3\u4f8b\u5916\u3002", "conclusion": "\u592a\u9633\u60ef\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u592a\u9633\u5468\u671f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u5747\u5300\u540c\u6b65\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ed1\u5b50\u6570\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u91cd\u529b\u6ce2\u8017\u6563\u5728\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u6052\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86TOI-2458\u548cGJ 504\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u5206\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u91cd\u529b\u6ce2\u8017\u6563\u5bf9\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u8f90\u5c04\u6838\u5fc3\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u65ad\u88c2\u548c\u5bf9\u6d41\u6838\u5fc3\u6052\u661f\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6ce2\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f6e\u6c50\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u79cd\u7fa4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u529b\u6ce2\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\uff0c\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e14\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u63a8\u6d4b\u7ea620%\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u66fe\u541e\u566c\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u90e8\u91cd\u529b\u6ce2\u8017\u6563\u662f\u5851\u9020\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6052\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We present a newly compiled database of lunar regolith physical and geotechnical properties, including data collected by direct in-situ measurements from crewed missions, estimates inferred from surface interactions on the Moon and using remote sensing, as well as laboratory analyses of samples returned to Earth. The data collected include, among others, the angle of internal friction and cohesion (both Mohr-Coulomb model parameters), bulk density, and static bearing capacity, extracted from Luna and Apollo-era historical mission documentation all the way to contemporary Lunar programs. The dataset specifies the type and location of the tests from which each value was obtained. Our database also includes parameters for lunar regolith simulants, providing a direct link between mission data and laboratory studies. In addition to centralizing this information, we developed a user interface that facilitates data retrieval, filtering, and visualization. This interface enables users to generate customized plots for comparative analysis. Developed in an open-science perspective, it is designed to evolve in response to the community's needs.

We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the \"reflex motion\") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A)", "summary": "Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7532\u9187\u53ca\u5176\u6c18\u5316\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u51b0\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u4e3aJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9274\u5b9a\u6c18\u5316\u7532\u9187\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8c31\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6c18\u5316\u7532\u9187\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6c18\u5206\u998f\u5728\u6052\u661f\u548c\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u524d\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5728CASICE\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4f7f\u7528Bruker Vertex 70v\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u548c\u6c26\u51b7\u51bb\u5668\uff0c\u572810 K\u9ad8\u771f\u7a7a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6c89\u79ef\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u51b0\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f556000-30 cm-1\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6c18\u5316\u7532\u9187\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982CH2DOH\u57281293\u548c1326 cm-1\u7684\u53cc\u5cf0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c18\u5316\u7532\u9187\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8c31\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e3aJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9274\u5b9a\u6c18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7ea6\u675f\u6c18\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7JWST\u5bf9\u6634\u661f\u56e2\u661f\u4e91\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b7\u4e2d\u6027\u4ecb\u8d28\uff08CNM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684PAH\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c2\u6d4b\u6634\u661f\u56e2\u661f\u4e91\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u6e4d\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u53ca\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JWST\u7684NIRCam\u5bf9\u6634\u661f\u56e2\u661f\u4e91\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e3a0.2 mpc\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790PAH\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6052\u661f\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u51cf\u53bb\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5b87\u5b99\u80cc\u666f\u6b8b\u4f59\u3002", "result": "PAH\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u65e0\u95f4\u65ad\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u5728\u9760\u8fd1Merope\u661f\u65f6\u4e3a-3.5\uff0c\u8f83\u8fdc\u533a\u57df\u4e3a-3\uff1b\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0ePAH\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u660eCNM\u4e2d\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u661f\u9645\u6e4d\u6d41\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\\leq M_{200\\mathrm{c}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cd\u5b50\u53cd\u9988\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7X\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AGN\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3AGN\u53cd\u9988\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22X\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86FLAMINGO\u5b87\u5b99\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790X\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eDark Energy Survey\u548cROSAT\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u5206\u8fa8AGN\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8003\u8651AGN\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u8981\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398X\u5c04\u7ebf-\u900f\u955c\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347AGN\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5916\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u6253\u7834\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u3002"}}
