### [1] [Fast pre-merger detection of massive black-hole binaries in LISA based on time-frequency excess power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16792)
*Francesco Nobili,Malvina Bellotti,Riccardo Buscicchio,Massimo Dotti,Alessandro Lupi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出一种快速算法，用于探测双黑洞合并前的引力波信号并进行初步表征，适用于实时预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LISA预计观测宇宙时间尺度的双黑洞合并引力波，需高效探测和表征合并前信号。

Method: 使用时频谱图搜索鸣叫信号（chirp），通过四极频率演化定义信号显著性，并通过一致性追踪器分组触发信号。

Result: 在Sangria数据集上成功探测15个信号，14个在合并前数小时至数周被检测。计算成本低（单核10天数据<1秒），提供高精度质量估计（误差<3%）和时间不确定性（几小时）。

Conclusion: 算法适合实时预警，触发观测保护期，并为贝叶斯参数估计提供先验信息。

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to observe gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries across cosmic time. Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.

### [2] [Status of the STIS Auto-wavecal Exposures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16946)
*D. Welty,S. Lockwood*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文讨论了STIS光谱观测中默认波标光谱的行为，分析了波标灯衰减对波长校准的影响，并建议增加最短波长设置的曝光时间以确保校准可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究STIS波标光谱的行为及其校准精度，源于Pt/Cr-Ne灯的衰减（尤其是短波长范围），可能导致波长校准不准。

Method: 通过分析SHIFTA1/SHIFTA2值的分布、重新评估灯的波长依赖性衰减，并进行模拟实验以估算所需曝光时间。

Result: 当前波标光谱能提供合理的SHIFTA值，但最短波长设置的曝光时间需要增加以确保灯进一步衰减时的校准可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议增加最短波长波标光谱的默认曝光时间，以维持未来波长校准的准确性。

Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the default ``wavecal'' spectra obtained together with most STIS spectroscopic exposures, which are needed for proper wavelength calibration of the science data. Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade.

### [3] [Kolmogorov analysis of pulsar TOA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17188)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 摘要描述了一种基于Kolmogorov随机性参数(KSP)的分析方法，用于量化NANOGrav脉冲星计时数据中白噪声的随机性程度及其非均匀性和非平稳性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机在于探索脉冲星计时数据中白噪声的随机性特性，以揭示其背后的物理过程，并通过KSP评估观测数据与计时模型的一致性。

Method: 方法包括对68颗脉冲星的到达时间(TOA)数据计算KSP，分析其随机性程度和非均匀性，以及研究随机性的时间依赖性。

Result: 结果显示白噪声的随机性在不同脉冲星中存在显著差异，且其时间依赖性表明存在非平稳物理过程影响。

Conclusion: 结论表明KSP是评估观测与模型一致性的有效工具，并可揭示随机背景信号中多种物理过程的贡献。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: ASTERIS是一种基于Transformer的自监督去噪算法，通过整合多曝光时空信息，显著提升天文图像的检测极限，并在JWST和Subaru望远镜数据中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天文成像观测的检测极限受多种噪声源限制，部分噪声在像素和曝光间具有相关性，可通过学习进行修正。

Method: 提出ASTERIS算法，利用自监督Transformer架构，整合多曝光的时空信息进行去噪。

Result: 在模拟数据中，ASTERIS将90%完整性和纯度的检测极限提升1.0星等；在JWST和Subaru数据中，发现此前不可见的低表面亮度星系结构及引力透镜弧，并在深空JWST图像中识别出3倍多的红移>9星系候选体。

Conclusion: ASTERIS通过去噪显著提高了天文图像的探测能力，为微弱天体结构的发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.

### [5] [On Eccentric Protoplanetary Disks I -- How Eccentric are Planet-Perturbed Disks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16769)
*Cory Padgett,Jeffrey Fung*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文研究了原行星盘在外行星开深间隙时的偏心现象，分析了二维流体力学模拟，并提出一个平衡模型来描述外盘的稳态偏心度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨原行星盘在外行星开深间隙时的偏心现象及其定量描述方法。

Method: 通过二维流体力学模拟和理论分析，推导了一个描述外盘偏心度的半解析模型。

Result: 外盘的稳态偏心度由1:3偏心Lindblad共振的激发和气体压力的阻尼平衡决定，推导的偏心度模型与数值模拟误差在30%以内。

Conclusion: 研究首次定量描述了原行星盘的偏心现象，为观测数据（如MWC 758等）的解读提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks can become eccentric when planets open deep gaps within, but how eccentric are they? We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with $q(\frac{h_p}{r_p})^{(-1)}(\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p})^{(a-\frac{b}{2}-2)}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, $\frac{h_p}{r_p}$ is the disk aspect ratio, $\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p}$ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and $a$ and $b$ are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%. Our result is a first step to quantitatively interpret observations of eccentric protoplanetary disks, such as MWC 758, HD 142527, IRS 48, and CI Tau.

### [6] [Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16801)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了外部极端紫外光蒸发对原行星盘演化的影响，提出了一种通过比较质量流失率和质量吸积率来区分粘性和磁流体动力学风驱动演化的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通过观测原行星盘的质量吸积率和大小来区分其演化路径的困难，特别是在外部光蒸发影响显著的极端环境中。

Method: 结合解析推导和一维数值模拟，研究了外部光蒸发对盘结构和吸积动力学的影响。

Result: 发现在粘性演化场景中，外部光蒸发流失率与恒星质量吸积率存在近乎一对一的关联，而磁流体动力学风驱动盘则无此趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果为区分原行星盘的演化机制提供了新的观测测试方法，但对相同天体的质量吸积率和外部光蒸发流失率的联合测量仍需克服技术和灵敏度限制。

Abstract: Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.

### [7] [Observational Signatures of Circumstellar Gas Tori Formed by Planetary Mass-Loss from Close-In Exoplanets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16816)
*Ethan Schreyer,Ruth Murray-Clay*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文研究了近距离系外行星因质量流失形成的环星尘埃环，并通过射线追踪模拟计算了其对恒星光的衰减作用，提出利用He I和Ca II谱线观测来识别这类系统。

Motivation: 研究动机是探索H/He大气层行星因流体动力学逃逸形成的环星尘埃环，及其对恒星光谱的影响。

Method: 方法包括建立物理模型模拟环星尘埃环，并通过射线追踪计算恒星光的衰减效应。

Result: 结果表明，环星尘埃环会显著增加He I 10830 Å谱线的等效宽度，结合Ca II H & K谱线可以区分这类系统。

Conclusion: 结论是提出联合观测He I和Ca II谱线，以搜寻行星质量流失形成的环星尘埃环。

Abstract: Close-in exoplanets with H/He atmospheres often undergo hydrodynamic escape. In extreme cases, it is hypothesized that the mass loss can be high enough for the escaping planetary material to wrap around the star, forming a long-lasting circumstellar torus. In this work, we develop a physical model of such circumstellar tori and use a ray tracing scheme to calculate the attenuation of stellar light passing through them. We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830~Å~line. When combined with observations of the star's Ca II H & K lines, these systems can typically be distinguished from field stars. Based on these results, we propose a survey of stars hosting close-in planets, combining observations of the He I 10830~Å~and Ca II H & K lines to search for circumstellar tori generated from planetary mass-loss in these systems.

### [8] [Kuiper Belt Formation via Grainy Planetary Migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16999)
*Patryk Sofia Lykawka,Jonathan Horner,Pedro Bernardinelli*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 利用N体模拟研究了Kuiper带45亿年的轨道演化，结合巨行星、Pluto级天体和原行星盘，揭示了主TNO群体的成因、共振捕获偏好及模型局限性，暗示需额外机制解释远距TNO群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Kuiper带结构的形成机制，特别是巨行星迁移和Pluto级天体的作用如何塑造主TNO群体的分布特征。

Method: 采用N体模拟，结合巨行星、1500个Pluto级天体和原行星盘，分析67个模拟系统，评估共振捕获、散射体产生及迁移效应。

Result: 
1. 所有系统重现主TNO群体（冷/热经典、共振、散射、脱离）。
2. 共振捕获偏好近距MMR（如3:2），远距MMR（如5:2）较少。
3. "跳跃"海王星模型最匹配观测数据。
4. 原始散射盘增强远距MMR捕获但过量产生散射体。
5. 模型未能生成脱离（>40 au）和高倾角（>45°）群体，也无法复现特定观测空白。
6. "颗粒"迁移效应早期显著，随Pluto级天体减少而减弱。

Conclusion: 四巨行星模型能够解释50 au内的Kuiper带结构，但对远距、高倾角和极端TNO群体无效，暗示需引入额外机制（如未发现的遥远行星）。

Abstract: We used N-body simulations to model the 4.5 Gyr orbital evolution of the early Kuiper Belt, incorporating a massive protoplanetary disk, the four giant planets, and 1500 primordial Pluto-class bodies ("Plutos") that drove Neptune's grainy migration. The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q > 40 au) and high-i (i > 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a > 245 au), low-i detached (i < 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i < 20 deg), and extreme (q > 50 au or i > 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at ~150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs. Additional processes (e.g., a distant undiscovered planet) are required for a comprehensive outer solar system framework.

Abstract: The formation of planetesimals was an integral part of the cascading series of processes that built the terrestrial planets. To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times (~0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after ~0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Atmospheric escape driven by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a critical process shaping the evolution of close-in exoplanets. Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data.

Method: 采用二维盘演化模型对500个颗粒进行拉格朗日运输和辐射模拟，结合UV辐射和热处理的CO2:NH3冰实验数据。

Result: 20K释放的颗粒几乎无法到达木星系统，而80K释放的厘米级颗粒（45%）和微米级颗粒（30%）可通过热处理形成复杂有机分子，并在30万年运输到木星系统。

Conclusion: 伽利略卫星内部的氮物种可能源自原太阳星云中复杂有机分子的形成和运输。

Abstract: Complex organic molecules are key markers of molecular diversity, and their formation conditions in protoplanetary disks remain an active area of research. These molecules have been detected on a variety of celestial bodies, including icy moons, and may play a crucial role in shaping the current composition of the Galilean moons. Experimental studies suggest that their formation could result from UV irradiation or thermal processing of NH3:CO2 ices. In this context, we investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula and their subsequent transport to the Jupiter system region. Lagrangian transport and irradiation simulations of 500 individual particles are performed using a two-dimensional disk evolution model. Based on experiments with UV irradiation and thermal processing of CO2:NH3 ice, this model allows us to estimate the estimate the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules through these processes. Almost none of the particles released at a local temperature of 20 K (corresponding to ~12 AU from the Sun) reach the location of the system of Jupiter. However, when released at a local temperature of 80 K (~7 AU), approximately 45% of the centimetric particles and 30% of the micrometric particles can form complex organic molecules via thermal processing, subsequently reaching the location of the system of Jupiter within 300 kyr. Assuming that the Galilean moons formed in a cold circumplanetary disk around Jupiter, the nitrogen-bearing species potentially present in their interiors could have originated from the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula.

Abstract: Saturn's moon Titan exhibits remarkable parallels to the Earth in many geophysical and geological processes not found elsewhere in the solar system at the present day. These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions.

Method: 通过轨道计算和光变曲线分析，推断彗星的轨道周期、碎片来源及其可能的母体。

Result: 该彗星可能是公元363年观测到的彗星碎片，是继12世纪以来Aristotle彗星的第二代表碎片，且光变曲线平滑无爆发。

Conclusion: 彗星MAPS的轨道特性和起源支持Kreutz系统的接触双星假说，但其亮度增长不太可能达到类似彗星Ikeya-Seki的水平。

Abstract: This paper describes progress achieved in early investigations of the orbital motion and light curve of comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS), the third ground-based discovery of a Kreutz sungrazer in the 21st century. The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts. To reach the brightness of comet Ikeya-Seki, the comet would have to follow an r^(-17) law in the coming weeks, which is unlikely.

Abstract: The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.

TL;DR: 研究了Gaia24ccy系统中的奇特爆发事件，揭示了其独特的爆发特征和可能的触发机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年轻恒星物体的吸积驱动爆发事件样本较少，限制了对其理解。本研究旨在详细探索Gaia24ccy系统的爆发行为。

Method: 通过分析Gaia24ccy系统的光变曲线和周期图，结合中红外颜色演化和发射线光谱，推断爆发机制和触发位置。

Result: 发现两次爆发具有相似的光变演化模式，推测触发区域位于恒星附近的小尺度范围内，并提出了热粘滞和磁层压缩的混合触发机制。

Conclusion: Gaia24ccy的爆发行为支持了一种混合触发机制模型，并解释了中红外颜色变化的原因。

Abstract: Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects remain poorly understood, largely limited by a statistically small sample of closely followed-up events. This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $Δg \sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\rm trigger} \simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\sim5-12.3 R_\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\rm acc}\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.

TL;DR: 通过Gaia DR3数据，研究者追踪了39颗高纬度B型星和447个银河系疏散星团的运动轨迹，以寻找过去的交汇点，并确认了可能的母子关系，最终确定了5颗B型星的起源。

Motivation: 探究高纬度B型星的可能起源，研究它们是否是从疏散星团中抛射出来的。

Method: 使用Gaia DR3高质量天体测量数据，追踪39颗高纬度B型星和447个疏散星团的运动轨迹，并结合HR图和星团核心环境分析可能的抛射机制。

Result: 确定了5颗B型星的起源，并提供了其可能的抛射时间、速度和机制；还发现一颗星的运动轨迹未靠近银河系盘面，讨论了其可能的起源。

Conclusion: 研究证实部分高纬度B型星是通过抛射机制从疏散星团中脱离的，为理解这类恒星的形成和运动提供了新证据。

Abstract: OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.

TL;DR: 研究了与2023年5月14日的CME相关的多个II型射电暴，分析了日冕条件和射电暴可能的产生位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在确定II型射电暴的产生条件和CME内部激波的起源区域。

Method: 结合GOES-SUVI、SOHO-LASCO和白光及极紫外观测数据，以及地面I-LOFAR的10-240MHz射电观测，使用PFSS和MHD模型分析日冕等离子体条件。

Result: 识别出四个II型射电暴，激波速度为443-2075 km/s，漂移率为-361至-78 kHz/s，激波超阿尔芬速度。射电暴产生于CME侧翼附近，开放磁力线和低阿尔芬速度促进了激波形成。

Conclusion: 多仪器研究表明，单个CME可产生多个II型射电暴，其生成位置与CME侧翼的低阿尔芬速度和开放磁力线相关。

Abstract: This study characterises a series of type~II radio bursts associated with a CME that occurred on 14 May, focusing on the coronal conditions during the event and identifying the likely location of the shocks where the radio bursts are generated. The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfvénic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.

Motivation: 锂作为天体物理学中的关键元素，其观测和理论研究对于理解恒星演化、星系形成和宇宙学具有重要意义。本文旨在总结当前领域的研究进展，揭示锂丰度模式的统一解释。

Method: 文章通过综述恒星不同演化阶段的锂观测数据，并结合现有的恒星演化模型，分析了锂的来源和演化过程。重点关注了化学元素和角动量的传输机制、新星的可能贡献以及银河系中恒星径向迁移的作用。

Conclusion: 锂的研究为恒星演化和星系考古学提供了重要线索。未来的理论和观测工作需进一步验证新星作为锂来源的假设，并深入探讨恒星迁移对锂丰度分布的影响。

Abstract: Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology. We review the Li observations in stars at different phases of their evolution, the strengths and the limitations of the current theoretical stellar models to explain the Li abundance data, our understanding of the Li sources and of the evolution of Li through- out the Galactic history. Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.

Motivation: 为了在宇宙学分析中提取更多信息，需要超越两点统计量，但高阶NPCFs计算复杂度高且信息利用效率不明确。机器学习方法虽高效，但缺乏物理直觉。

Result: 在模拟透镜收敛图中验证了框架的有效性，展示了学习方法在NPCF各阶信息提取中的应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理信息驱动的模拟推理提供了新方向，平衡了效率和物理直觉。

Abstract: Cosmological analyses are moving past the well understood 2-point statistics to extract more information from cosmological fields. A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example. We view our approach as an exciting new avenue for physics-informed simulation-based inference.

Conclusion: 结论表明，符号变化的暗能量模型在描述宇宙演化时具有独特性，并为宇宙结构形成提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models in which the cosmological constant evolves from negative values in the early Universe to a positive value at low redshifts. This framework includes a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as smooth-transition scenarios, providing a unified description of sign-changing cosmological constants. We analyse the theoretical construction and background dynamics of these models using cosmographic diagnostics. Extending this study to the linear perturbation regime, we solve the perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era with adiabatic initial conditions. We examine the evolution of the matter density contrast, gravitational potential, and the $fσ_8$ observable. Our results are compared against the standard $Λ$CDM model and confronted with current observational data, illustrating the phenomenological viability of sign-changing dark energy models and revealing distinctive imprints on cosmic structure formation arising from the transition of the cosmological constant.

TL;DR: 研究通过平滑分量过滤（SCF）抑制前景干扰，成功估计了21 cm双谱，并验证了其在Murchison Widefield Array（MWA）观测中的有效性，为再电离时代（EoR）信号设置了严格的上下限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 21 cm双谱是研究再电离时代（EoR）的有力工具，但观测受到前景干扰的严重阻碍。研究旨在通过SCF方法抑制前景，从而实现对EoR信号的准确估计。

Method: 采用平滑分量过滤（SCF）技术处理MWA在154.2 MHz的观测数据，并在模拟信号中验证了21 cm双谱的恢复能力。对实际数据进行SCF处理后，评估3D球形双谱并限制EoR信号。

Result: SCF显著抑制了前景干扰，降低了双谱振幅3-4个数量级，并减少了数据中缺失频率通道带来的伪影。最终给出了EoR信号的严格下极限Δ³_LL=−(1.25×10⁴)³ mK³和上极限Δ³_UL=(1.22×10⁴)³ mK³。

Conclusion: SCF方法有效改善了EoR信号的观测窗口，为进一步降低噪声水平和更严格限制EoR信号奠定了基础。

Abstract: The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\parallel} \ge [k_\parallel]_f=0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp},k_{3\perp},k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \perp},k_{2 \perp},k_{3 \perp})\leq 0.026~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel},k_{3\parallel})>0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $Δ^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $Δ^3_{\rm LL}=-(1.25\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $Δ^3_{\rm UL}=(1.22\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.

TL;DR: 提出了一个流体力学框架，用于描述修正引力（MG）中球形空洞的演化，通过引入有效耦合扩展了广义相对论（GR）和动态暗能量的处理方式，并将其应用于具体模型。

Motivation: 扩展GR和动态暗能量对空洞演化的描述，研究MG对空洞演化及观测量的影响，并提供理论与观测的直接联系。

Method: 通过将引力修正编码为Euler和Poisson方程中的有效耦合，推导出Eulerian密度对比的非线性演化方程，并将其应用于luminal Galileon模型。

Result: MG对引力耦合的修正约为10%，对空洞密度演化的影响在百分位水平，而在映射和壳层交叉阈值中的偏差低于百分之一。空洞始终位于物理分支的非屏蔽区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为MG模型中的空洞动力学和一致性约束提供了自洽的预测途径。

Abstract: We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models.

Abstract: We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.

Motivation: 探究局部体积中低质量孤立矮星系的恒星形成特性及大小，揭示环境对其演化的影响。

Method: 使用ELVES-Field样本，通过表面亮度波动确定距离，筛选2300个候选者，确认95个为局部体积成员。选择离已知星系群投影距离大于2倍维里半径的孤立矮星系进行分析。

Result: 高质量矮星系($M_\\star \\gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\\odot$)均为恒星形成，低质量矮星系($M_\\star \\lesssim 10^7$ $M_\\odot$)约30%熄灭。孤立矮星系比同质量卫星矮星系小约20%。

Conclusion: 孤立矮星系的恒星形成和大小显著受环境影响，低质量矮星系的熄灭比例较高，且孤立矮星系普遍更小。

Abstract: We use a new sample of low-mass ($M_* < 10^9$ $M_\odot$) isolated galaxies from the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field) to examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc). This volume-limited sample was selected from nearly 3,000 square degrees of imaging, relying on surface brightness fluctuations to determine distances to the majority of the systems and is complete to $M_* \approx 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Across the surveyed area, we catalog over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, of which we confirm 95 as genuine LV members and reject over 1600 as background contaminants, with the remaining 600 candidates still requiring a distance measurement. Of the confirmed LV dwarfs, 46 are either new discoveries or confirmed via a distance measurement for the first time here. We explore different environmental criteria to select isolated dwarfs but primarily focus on dwarfs that are $>2\times R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in projection from any known group with $M_\star > 10^9$ $M_\odot$. We find that, at higher dwarf masses ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\odot$), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming as has been found before. In contrast, at $M_\star \lesssim 10^7$ $M_\odot$, $\sim30\%$ of field dwarfs appear to be quenched. Finally, we find that isolated dwarfs are noticeably smaller ($\sim 20\%$) than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.

Motivation: 研究四重透镜类星体的几何构型和透镜星系的性质，填补对视场中单星系强透镜系统中小角度分离透镜的认知空白。

Method: 通过HST和JWST观测三个红移不同的四重透镜类星体，采用奇异等温椭球质量分布和Sérsic椭圆光剖模型对透镜星系建模，测量爱因斯坦半径和红移范围。

Result: 透镜星系的最佳拟合模型显示典型的de Vaucouleurs光剖（$n_{\rm Sérsic} \sim 4$）和有效半径$R_e$约为1.5-3.5千秒差距，红移范围分别为0.5-1.2、1.0-1.5和0.4-0.9，代表一类未被充分研究的小角度分离透镜系统。

Abstract: We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic} \sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the shock chemistry in the protostellar outflow of NGC1333 IRAS4B1, detecting COMs and deuterated species, and highlights its potential as a new laboratory for studying COM formation and destruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of shocks on complex organic molecule (COM) chemistry by analyzing the molecular composition of the IRAS4B1 outflow, a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry.

Method: Used data from the PRODIGE program to map COM emission and derive molecular abundances in the IRAS4B1 outflow, comparing intensity ratios and rotational temperatures between different species.

Result: Detected COMs like CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH, along with deuterated species, with abundances higher than in the L1157-B1 outflow. Rotational temperatures ranged ~50-100 K, and morphological differences were observed between outflow lobes.

Conclusion: The IRAS4B1 outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, offering insights into COM formation, destruction, and outflow dynamics, with potential for further discoveries through targeted observations.

Abstract: Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测和研究MIDIS中最深的MIRI-red源，以了解高红移星系及其物理特性。

Method: 使用5σ显著性检测和红移颜色定义MIRI-red源，评估探测的纯度和完整性，分析候选星系的物理起源。

Result: 发现7个MIRI-red候选星系，包括高红移候选体，估计其发射线等效宽度或巴尔莫断裂值。

Conclusion: MIRI-red源可能与高发射线星系或高红移巴尔莫断裂星系相关，但与理论预期的LRD数量不一致。

Abstract: We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6~μm MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4~arcmin$^2$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$σ$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\% and completeness of 54\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(Hα) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) \ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(Hα) \sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) \sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$α$ or H$β$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了星际介质中硫代乙醛（CH$_{3}$CHS）的形成机制，发现其在气相中无势垒形成，而在冰粒表面上因位点特异性调制反应路径，且硫化学特性导致副产物硫醇形成。

Motivation: 理解冷分子云中硫化学的动力学机制及硫预算，解释硫代乙醛及其前体在星际中的观测现象。

Method: 采用电子结构方法和密度泛函理论，结合气相和冰粒表面模拟环境（通过W6和W22水簇模型），分析Langmuir-Hinshelwood和Eley-Rideal反应路径。

Result: 气相中CH$_{3}$CHS无势垒形成；冰粒表面反应路径受位点调制，副产物CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH可能降低CH$_{3}$CHS产率；首次测定了硫代乙醇在冰上的结合能，证实其挥发性高于乙醇。

Conclusion: 硫化学的复杂性揭示了星际介质中硫有机物的多样化行为，CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH是潜在的天文化学目标，需进一步通过定量模型验证观测差异。

Abstract: The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.

TL;DR: 研究了113个孤立星系CGM中H I和O VI气体的方位角依赖性，发现低质量星系中H I和O VI气体沿盘面极方向增强，而高质量星系中分布均匀且无显著方位依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨星系质量和方位角对CGM中H I和O VI气体分布的影响，揭示星系演化与CGM结构的关联。

Method: 利用MUSEQuBES数据，分析H I和O VI的覆盖分数及其与方位角的关系，并使用TPCF研究O VI气体的运动学特性。

Result: 低质量星系H I和O VI气体沿盘面和极方向分布增强；高质量星系O VI分布均匀且无方位依赖性；O VI气体运动学沿盘面更窄。

Conclusion: O VI分布受星系整体性质调控，但其运动学仍保留来源记忆，表明CGM结构与星系质量及方位角相关。

Abstract: We investigate the azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 113 isolated galaxies in the redshift range 0.12 < z < 0.75, including 91 new measurements from the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏光谱测量，对UFCSs的性质和起源知之甚少。本文旨在通过首次大样本光谱分析，揭示这一极端卫星群的动力学和化学特性。

Method: 使用Magellan/IMACS和Keck/DEIMOS观测了19个UFCSs，测量了径向速度、速度弥散、金属丰度、金属弥散以及基于Gaia的自行运动。

Result: 研究发现UFCSs平均运动学温度低于UFDs，化学多样性显著（铁丰度跨幅达300倍），部分可能为迄今发现的最小星系。

Conclusion: UFCSs的多样性和部分系统的特性表明，其中约50%可能是最小的星系，挑战了传统球状星团的定义。

Abstract: Deep, wide-area photometric surveys have uncovered a population of compact ($r_{1/2} \approx$ 1-15 pc), extremely-low-mass ($M_* \approx$ 20-4000 $M_{\odot}$) stellar systems in the Milky Way halo that are smaller in size than known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) and substantially fainter than most classical globular clusters (GCs). Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of "Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\rm -3.3 \lesssim [Fe/H] \lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the "metallicity floor" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.

Abstract: Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $γ$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$γ$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.

Abstract: We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.

Abstract: In this paper we present 16 early-phase type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the pilot survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST-PS) from March 4 to July 10, 2024, including three SNe Ia with early-excess emission features (EExSNe Ia). The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.

Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $Δm_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $Δm_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.

Abstract: We investigate the multiband photometric properties of seven supernovae (SNe) showing double-peaked light-curve evolution and prominent shock-cooling emission, observed by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) during its first year of operation. By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.

Abstract: We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Seyfert星系Markarian 590的黑洞吸积动态生命周期，捕捉了其从1975年至2025年的多波长状态转变，揭示了与X射线双星类似的罕见AGN状态转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Markarian 590的动机在于利用长期多波段观测数据，首次在一个AGN中实时追踪完整的吸积状态转变，以验证尺度不变的吸积物理是否适用于不同质量的黑洞。

Method: 研究使用Swift天文台的十年多波段观测数据，分析X射线硬度强度图（HID），并通过X射线响度参数$α_{ox}$与爱丁顿比$λ_{Edd}$的关系来描述状态转变。此外，还将结果与黑洞活动的基本平面进行了对比。

Result: 研究发现，Mkn 590经历了从暗硬X射线状态到亮UV/软X射线状态的完整转变，$α_{ox}$与$λ_{Edd}$呈'V'形关系，转折点为$λ_{Edd}$=0.021。状态转变时间约为10年，低于薄盘的经典粘滞时标但符合内盘热波传播模型。在基本平面上，Mkn 590的斜率比预期平坦70%，表明在辐射高效状态下仍存在日冕-喷流的耦合。

Conclusion: 研究证实Mkn 590是一个罕见的实时分辨AGN状态转变案例，为跨黑洞质量谱的尺度不变吸积物理提供了有力证据。

Abstract: The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.
