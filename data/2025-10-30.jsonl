The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,\ncurrent analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the\nbackground at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the\nquality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of\nsmall-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and\ncharacterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical\nformalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this\nsystematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches."}

Such\nactive regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and\n2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number.

We investigate the characteristics of reconnection-driven\nnanojets just before and during a prominence eruption using the High Resolution\nImager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter\nduring its perihelion on September 30, 2024. Extreme UV (EUV) images at\nunprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution from \\hrieuv were analysed.\nThe dimensions and propagation speeds of nanojets were estimated and used to\nestimate the kinetic energies. Nanojet activity was compared with GOES X-ray\nflux to assess its relation to flare evolution. The high spatial and temporal\nresolution in the EUV was found to be essential to fully capture the properties\nand numbers of reconnection nanojets. Approximately 120 nanojets were detected\nduring the eruption, with 40 analysed in detail. Nanojets exhibited lengths of\n$200 - 5000$~km, widths of $200 - 500$~km and durations of $2-12$~s. Instant\nvelocities ranged from 150 km~s$^{-1}- 600~$km~s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energies\nreaching $1.56\\times10^{27}$~erg. These nanojets are faster, longer, more\nenergetic and more numerous compared to previous studies. We also find clear\nsignatures of acceleration and deceleration, reflecting magnetic tension\nrelease and reach of new equilibria. Reconnection events during the eruption\nwere found to be more frequent and energetically intense. Pre-flare nanojet\nclustering indicates small-scale reconnection may precede large eruptive\nactivity. These results suggest that nanojets also occur in fully ionised\ncoronal plasma, playing a role in both quiescent and eruptive solar activity."}

Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to\nthe low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame.\nWe construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources:\n1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a\ncombination of the two.

Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets\norbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the\nrecent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current\nlimitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the\nhost star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time\nobservations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over\n350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial\nvelocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength\ndependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength\nindependent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of\nthe measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the\ndependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity\nindices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph\nand each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective\nturnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M\ndwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a\nstrong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the\nmeasured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV\npredicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with\nmoderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable\nactivity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar\nactivity and the search for low mass rocky planets."}

We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the\nquenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by\nthe kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active\nuntil strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially\nresolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback\ncan only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this\nsize-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a\nfew Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after\ntriggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies\nentirely.

The structure of the\ncavity is determined by the complex interplay between spirals induced by tidal\nforcing from the binary and the viscous and radiative damping of the spirals at\nthe cavity edge. To fully understand what determines the properties of observed\ncavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative\nprocesses in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary\ndiscs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size\nscales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models. We find that the\ndiverse cavity shapes are a natural outcome of the radially-varying cooling\ntimescale, as different radiative processes mediate cooling at different disc\nsize regimes. For binaries with separation of a few au, where the cooling\ntimescale is comparable to the orbital timescale at the cavity edge, we recover\nmuch more circular cavities than for quickly- or slowly-cooling discs. Our\nresults show that the cavity structure around several binary systems such as Cs\nCha and GG Tau can be explained with one physical model, and highlight the\nimportance of radiative cooling in modelling the dynamical evolution of\ncircumbinary discs."}

A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km\ns$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the\nmagnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field\nlines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to\nthe smaller-scale structure ($\\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field\nlines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced\nby the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have\nsimilar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation\ncould have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation\ntheory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the\ngas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years,\nconsistent with high-mass star formation time scales."}

Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets\norbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the\nrecent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current\nlimitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the\nhost star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time\nobservations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over\n350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial\nvelocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength\ndependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength\nindependent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of\nthe measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the\ndependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity\nindices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph\nand each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective\nturnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M\ndwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a\nstrong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the\nmeasured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV\npredicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with\nmoderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable\nactivity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar\nactivity and the search for low mass rocky planets."}

In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results\nfor the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to\nthat from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak\nfrequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The\nradio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The\ncombined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing\nsignificant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases\nproducing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra.

The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the\nquality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of\nsmall-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and\ncharacterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical\nformalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this\nsystematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches."}

We investigate the\ndependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity\nindices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph\nand each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective\nturnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M\ndwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a\nstrong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV.

As a result, unless the\ntidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between\nthe known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the\nAM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red\ngiants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to\nprovide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit\nof the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses\nand an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already\nrapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the\nobliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin\nstructure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS\nstage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment.\nThese discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for\nplanetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure."}

Its previous work is about forward shock\n  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715v1)", "summary": "The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a\nforward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a\nbow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different.\nTo elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted\ntwo-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the\nspatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on\ntheir spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to\nobtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results\nfor the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to\nthat from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak\nfrequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The\nradio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The\ncombined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing\nsignificant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases\nproducing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights\nthe importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas\non sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to\nreveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas."}

The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,\ncurrent analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the\nbackground at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the\nquality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of\nsmall-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and\ncharacterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical\nformalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this\nsystematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches."}

This paradigm has recently been challenged by the\nidentification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young\nactive galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets.\nAmong them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we\nreport the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s\nwith the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published\ncatalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed\nsources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We\nsuggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small\nangles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were\nidentified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of\nthe Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency\nArray, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source\nJ1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear\nsize of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet\nknown as of today.
