The survey consists of deep\nspectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field\nusing the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three\nmedium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13\nhours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of\nthe 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength\nrange. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over\nthe redshift range 1.7 < z < 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar\nmass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 Msun.The Blue Jay sample is\nrepresentative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without\nstrong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of\nmassive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters,\nwhich requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations.\nSince the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we\nconstruct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of\nthe science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets\nconsisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a\nsubstantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure\nmulti-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different\nways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from\nthe exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This\nenables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue\nJay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for\nstudying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon\ngalaxies."}

Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric,\nnon-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and\nneutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under\noptimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only\n<1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers\nremain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic\npopulations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD)\nbinaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling,\nwhereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable\nmass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington\nrate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the\nEddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer\ninstead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can\nclimb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric\nchannel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild\nrecycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular\nNS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond\npulsars."}

The\ncored ellipticals have been linked to the presence of supermassive black hole\nbinaries that excavate their hosts' central stellar populations through\nthree-body encounters. This connection between cores and black holes similarly\noperates in globular clusters, which also exhibit a bimodality in cored and\ncore-collapsed architectures, respectively rich and depleted in stellar black\nholes. We report new estimates of the total black hole mass in 25 Galactic\nglobular clusters based on a suite of roughly 150 Monte Carlo $N$-body\nsimulations that fit observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion\nprofiles. We show that both globular clusters and massive elliptical galaxies\nindividually exhibit strong correlations between total black hole mass\n($M_\\bullet$) and core radius ($r_c$), and that these individual relations\nshare a common power-law exponent to within $1\\sigma$ statistical precision:\n$M_\\bullet \\sim r_c^{1.3}$.

Recent\nattempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsupernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain\nthe impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the\nhottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be\nreproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions.

We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the\nevolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in\nestimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a\nhigh-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius\ndwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in\npotentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated\nthe winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density\ncontrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the\nphase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the\nwinding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre\npassage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the\nwinding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body\nsimulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\\gtrsim$\n300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of\nexcitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed\nby Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in\nthe disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase\nmixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by\nself-gravity is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood.\nAccounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase\nspiral to $\\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre\npassage.

Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment\noccurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a\nprotoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary\nsystem. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through\ninteraction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt\ndisks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not\nform at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB\n``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through\nstar-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to\nWR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers\non star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the\nenrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous\nN-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment\nis widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time\nat which the interloper intersects the star-forming region.

Additionally, we analysed the higher-order\ncontributions of $\\dot{\\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution.\nBoth the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger\nthan the current uncertainty of $\\dot{\\omega}$\n($\\delta\\dot{\\omega}=4\\times10^{-4}\\,\\rm deg\\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the\nhigher-order correction for the total mass."}

We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day\narchitecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions\nrequired. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two\nformalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT)\nframework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on\nWeywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital\ndistances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal\ntorques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin,\nhowever, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period\nbased on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value.\nA match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates\nand if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are\ninconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense\nsatellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most\nplausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated\ndwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated\nwarm (150-180K) ices.

Previous\nestimates of water content in M-dwarf systems have largely relied on population\nsynthesis or atmosphere-interior evolution models, often treating impacts and\natmospheric loss in isolation. In this work, we couple impact delivery, impact\nerosion, and mantle-atmosphere exchange within a model that tracks volatile\nevolution through stochastic collision histories. By explicitly including both\nplanetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M\ndwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e),\nspanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\\oplus,\\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of\ndisk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h\nanalogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass.\nThis systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation\nfor JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an\norigin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our\nresults suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form\nalready depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity\nto sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage\nframework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of\ncompact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet\ninterior compositions and atmospheric models."}

In the bulk velocity field,\nwe observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an\namplitude of $\\simeq\\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by\nthe recent merger event.

A refined sample was obtained through full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria and visual\ninspection. We identified 102 galaxies across the JWST/NIRCam field of view.\nThe magnitude (F444W) distribution is bimodal, with about 10% brighter than\nm_F444W < 15 mag and about 60% in the range 17 < m_F444W < 19 mag.

However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs\ntransport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative\ncontributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty\nis that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually\navailable to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504\ndisc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external\nphotoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In\nparticular, having the combination of accretion rate and external\nphotoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we\nrun a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can\nmatch the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs,\nfinding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport\n$\\alpha$ parameter is $3\\times10^{-4}\\leq\\alpha_{\\nu}\\leq2\\times10^{-3}$ for\nviscous discs, and $2\\times10^{-3}\\leq\\alpha_{\\rm DW}\\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD\nwind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature.

Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must\nhave formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds\nin the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the\nModules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model\nthe structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported\nenvelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the\nprogenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation\nintroduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and\nsaturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind\nand mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington\nradiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes\nto $\\geq 10^3\\,M_{\\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection\nmodels yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher\nthan Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can\ndramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless\nbalanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical\nlimits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds\ncapable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra.\nFuture extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation\nhydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the\nquasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation."}

Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment\noccurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a\nprotoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary\nsystem. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through\ninteraction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt\ndisks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not\nform at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB\n``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through\nstar-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to\nWR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers\non star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the\nenrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous\nN-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment\nis widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time\nat which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a\nfactor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many\ndisks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the\ninterloper is more evolved."}

We present a statistical\nanalysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the\ndistant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of\n81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless\npre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant\nvariability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance\n(~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to\nhigh-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars.\nThis mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars,\n7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability,\nwhile 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions\nwere found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward\nearlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely\ndriven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more\nsecular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion\nvariations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars\ngenerally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or\nvariable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in\nW1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot\nmodulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across\nevolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key\ninsight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars."}
