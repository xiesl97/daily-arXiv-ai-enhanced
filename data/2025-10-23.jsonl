Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars\non star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift\ngalaxies ($0.02$\\,$<$\\,z\\,$<$\\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys\nDR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair\ninteractions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of\ncompanion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their\nhost galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred\ngalaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more\npronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\\sim$\\,2.5 dex higher) than\nunbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have\nsuppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual\nrole of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven\nenhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate\nkpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when\na star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central\nstarbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and\ncontribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting\nfor both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF\nregulation in interacting galaxies."}

It was found that high\n(low) value for K correspond to outward (inward) migration. In this paper we\naim at understanding the mechanism driving inward/outward migration and why it\ncorrelates with the gap depth. We performed a suite of 2D, live-planet,\nlong-term simulations of massive planets migrating in discs with the hydro-code\nFargo3D. We focus on a range of planet masses (1-13 m_J) and disc aspect ratios\n(0.03-0.1) and analyze the evolution of orbital elements and gap structure. We\nalso study the torque contributions from outer Lindblad resonances to\ninvestigate their role in the migration outcome. We find that, while all\nplanets initially migrate inwards, those with high enough K eventually enter a\nphase in which the torque reverses sign and migration becomes outwards, until\neventually stalling. This behavior is associated with eccentricity growth in\nthe outer disc and changes in the gap structure. We identify the surface\ndensity ratio at the 1:2 and 1:3 outer Lindblad resonances as a key output\ndiagnostic that correlates with the migration direction. This ratio regulates\nthe migration for all the cases where the massive planet remains in an almost\ncircular orbit and the outer gap region exhibits moderate eccentricity. This\ncharacteristic sequence of inward-reversal-outwards-stalling occurs for a\nvariety of K values and thus further work is required to identify the\nsimulation input parameters that determine the onset of this sequence. Our\nresults suggest that outward migration in the planet-dominated regime is\nprimarily governed by the relative importance of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances\nand, therefore, the gap profile plays a crucial role in determining the\ndirection of migration."}

Their coupling\nto electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the\npresence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the\nmass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in\nwhich this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV\ngamma-ray sources.\n  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a\ndramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the\nPerseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended\nmagnetic field of strength O(10$\\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse,\nmaking it an excellent target to study ALPs.\n  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the\ngammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to\nultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a\npreference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be\nset. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to\nsetting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.\n  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination\nof mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level.\nWe provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and\ncoupling parameter space.

Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a\nfractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density\ndistribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for\nthe ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in\nthe Stripe 82 region. The observed color--color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$)\ndiagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the\ninterstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is\nmodified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by\nenhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained\nby adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths.

Submitted to Astronomy&Astrophysics", "summary": "Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the\nsubordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar\nchromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical\nmechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments.\n  Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we\nstudy the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency\nredistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel\nsemi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity\nof these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations,\naccounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects.\n  Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core\nregions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The\nmetastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering\npolarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines\nrespond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the\ninfrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss\nfields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect\nmodifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the\nplane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear\npolarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from\nsub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger\nfields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical\neffects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level\npolarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant\nlines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic\ncomponent in this frequency range."}

Using simulations the study tracks how sudden\naccretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)\nduring which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains\nnearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition\nbetween two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,\nand how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that\nboosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest\neffect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the\nregion of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In\nparticular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,\nlasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce\nthe superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In\ncontrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause\ntemporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes\nwith lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show\nobservable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier\naxion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to\nproduce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion."}

However, strong radiation-driven winds can\ndramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless\nbalanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical\nlimits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds\ncapable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra.\nFuture extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation\nhydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the\nquasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation."}

We\ndetermined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and\ntheir connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster's regions of influence,\nanalysed galaxy content of clusters, and derived scaling relations between\ncluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five\ncomponents and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of\ninfluence are $R_\\mathrm{inf} \\approx 4$ Mpc, and the density contrast at their\nborders is $\\Delta\\rho_{inf} \\approx 50 - 60$. The scaling relations between\nthe masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the\nclusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In\nsuperclusters the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in\nlow-density regions between superclusters. The collapse of the regions of\ninfluence of clusters started at redshifts $z \\approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will\nbe virialised in $\\approx 3.3$ Gyrs.

Of the stripped stars which show\nUV excess, $25-45\\,\\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or\nimproved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict\ncontamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars\nwith spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting\nhigher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models\nand realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations."}

The former is thought to form a\ngeometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick\nhot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,\ni.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a\ncorona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by\nanalysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona\ncondensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that\nthe accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission\nspectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of\ncold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington\nvalue, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the\nfraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various\nspectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,\nregardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always\ndisc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at\nvery low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is\nexpected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of\nCygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion\nflow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI\nobservations."}

High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures", "comment": "31 pages, 15 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16\ndisks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a\nvariety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and\nincluding circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The\ndisk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral\nindex (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk\nsizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity\nprofiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key\ndifferences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the\ndisk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the\npredicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at\na given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant\noptical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to\nexplain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required\nfor the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating.\nConsidering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range\n30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal\ngravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au,\nbut it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower\noptical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust\nmasses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD),\nsuggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred\nhigh optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity\nof dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence\nfor early planet formation (ABRIDGED)."}

Carvalho Jr.", "Lech Piotrowski"], "title": "Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$ and primary composition", "comment": null, "summary": "We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field\namplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\\rm max}$ in the atmosphere,\neven accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an\n$X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this\nimplies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF\nshape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained\nin terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes\nwith $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is\na zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density\nscaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other\nscaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the\ncore at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper\nshowers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to\nlarger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF\namplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly\ninfer, even bypassing any $X_{\\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary\ncomposition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions\non other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\\rm\nmax}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods."}

However, a major\nobservational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform\ndata, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps\ncan significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe\nsource variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational\ngaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically\nevaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine\nperiodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation\nis conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a\nrange of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular\nSpectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant\ndegradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds\n50\\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly\ndistorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA\nstands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite\nhigh data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify\nartificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling\neffects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.\nFinally, the periods detected with $\\geq$3$\\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to\nresult from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed\ntime series."}

Another notable\ncandidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a\npotential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this\nsource returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated\nby two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and\nIC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV,\nimplying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC\n1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino\nspectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT\nobservations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade\nflux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV\nflux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the\nneutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons\nare accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and\nX-rays from the corona through the $p\\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with\nenergy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required\nmaximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to\nunity ($\\sigma\\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization\nparameter with $\\sigma\\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated\ncomposition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino\nspectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different\nmagnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN."}
