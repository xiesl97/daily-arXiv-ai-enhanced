Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "generate a too long; didn't read summary", "motivation": "describe the motivation in this paper", "method": "method of this paper", "result": "result of this paper", "conclusion": "conclusion of this paper"}}

This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound.

Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316EV\u5145\u7535\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\uff08\u961f\u5217\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7ad9\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7aEV\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65c5\u884c\u548c\u6392\u961f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ad9\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u548c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5feb\u901f\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5145\u7535\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u534f\u8c03EV\u9009\u62e9\u7ad9\u70b9\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9632\u5cf0\u503c\u3001\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u7ad9\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u6216\u5145\u7535\u8bf7\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u7a81\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5145\u7535\u4f4d\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u957f\u961f\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0cEV\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u8212\u9002\uff08\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\uff08\u6574\u4f53\u961f\u5217\uff09\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ad9\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7aEV\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0Pareto\u6700\u4f18trade-off\u3002", "result": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cEV\u548c\u5145\u7535\u7ad9\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65c5\u884c\u548c\u6392\u961f\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9002\u65f6\u81ea\u79c1\u6216\u5229\u4ed6\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e2d\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u77ed\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ad9\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027EV\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "EV\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u673a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u81ea\u79c1\u6216\u5229\u4ed6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u77ed\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316EV\u5145\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u9002\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\uff09\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u6839\u636e\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\u3001\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u9c81\u68d2\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\uff1b\u572816\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a consistently \u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3002"}}

Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.", "AI": {"tldr": "AssurAI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u97e9\u8bed\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b11,480\u4e2a\u8de8\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8635\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u97e9\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u7684AI\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u97e9\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u5e94\u5b9a\u4e4935\u79cdAI\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u901a\u7528\u5371\u5bb3\u548c\u97e9\u56fd\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u5883\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaAssurAI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u9020\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u79cd\u5b50+\u4f17\u5305\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u91cd\u72ec\u7acb\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea2\u961f\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1AssurAI\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u671fLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03AssurAI\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u97e9\u56fd\u793e\u533a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority.

Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "CANVAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff08UI\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b598\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5236\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cVLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5177\u5907\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7f16\u8f91UI\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177-based\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165CANVAS\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbVLMs\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3.3K\u79fb\u52a8UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0830\u529f\u80fd\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b598\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177-based\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a(i)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u6574\u4e2aUI\u5c4f\u5e55\uff1b(ii)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u73b0\u6709\u5c4f\u5e55\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\uff1bVLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff08\u5982\u521b\u5efa\u77e9\u5f62\u6309\u94ae\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u66f4\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1VLMs\u5de5\u5177-based UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08TIE\uff09\uff0c\u4f7fVLMs\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1TIE\uff0c\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u57281B\u548c3B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\uff0c9\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53471.5\u548c1.3\u5206\uff0cDocVQA\u548cInfoVQA\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u5206\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u534a\u56fe\u50cf\u74e6\u7247\uff08tokens\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "TIE\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a grounding\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u5197\u957f\u590d\u6742\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u91cd\u7ec4\u6587\u6863\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u9662\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad81.5%~4.36%\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u867d\u5177\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u957f\u800c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u586b\u8865\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a(i) \u6309\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u7ec4\u6587\u6863\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b(ii) \u5b9a\u4e49\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u719f\u6089\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\uff1b(iii) \u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u9662\u9488\u5bf9\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u4f4e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea61.5%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad84.36%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u91cd\u7ec4\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u672f\u8bed\u53ca\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584LLMs\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

The annotated dataset contains over \\textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.", "AI": {"tldr": "MindSET\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eceReddit curated\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc71300\u4e07\u6761\u6807\u6ce8\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e03\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6e05\u6d17\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u65f6\u5fc3\u7406\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u4eceReddit\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u62a5\u8bca\u65ad curation \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u79fb\u9664NSFW\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528LIWC\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cBoW\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u8d851300\u4e07\u6761\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u662f\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u591a\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728MindSET\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe18\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MindSET\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u5fc3\u7406\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines.

To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques.

We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.\n  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.\n  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff084-8\u500d\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u9009\u62e9\uff08DTS\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5197\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee4\u724c\u6d6a\u8d39\uff1b\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DTS\u4f7f\u7528\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u677f\uff1a\u7b80\u5355MLP\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u8c03RoBERTa\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff1b\u57281,000\u4e2aMMLU\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3/\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8de83\u5927LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff08GPT-4\u3001Gemini\u3001Claude\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "MLP\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u738790.5%\uff0c\u7565\u4f18\u4e8eRoBERTa\uff0889.5%\uff09\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c111.25\u4ebf\uff1b\u8de8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4ee4\u724c\u51cf\u5c1132.6%-33.9%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc79,000\u6b21\u751f\u4ea7API\u8c03\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793abeam search\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5bb9\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u660e\uff1b\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u641c\u7d22\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0cbeam search\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "(i) \u5206\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b(ii) \u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f30\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff1b(iii) \u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548cCNN\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6beam search 10-40%\u89e3\u91ca\u6b21\u4f18\uff1b\u65b0\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u4f53\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347beam search\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations.

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

Wallace", "Sen Wang"], "title": "Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

Under review", "summary": "Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \\citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\\% on the English test set and 50.7\\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\\% on English and 69.3\\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bba\u5143\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u82f1\u8bed\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u8bedMicrotext\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523074.8% F1\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u5143\u6316\u6398\u662fNLP\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3001\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f46\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bedMicrotext\u8bed\u6599\u53ca\u5176\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u5e73\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff1a(i) \u4ec5\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b(ii) LLM\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b(iii) \u7ed3\u5408\u82f1\u8bed\u539f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed50.2%\u3001\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed50.7% F1\uff1bLLM\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed59.2%\u3001\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed69.3% F1\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe74.8% F1\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aLLM\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8bba\u5143\u6316\u6398\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u3002"}}

Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition).

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).", "AI": {"tldr": "V^2-SAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5c06SAM2\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5728Ego-Exo4D\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6211-\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u56fe\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u5267\u70c8\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5982SAM2\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faV^2-SAM\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv3\u7684V^2-Anchor\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301SAM2\u5750\u6807\u63d0\u793a\uff1bV^2-Visual\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5339\u914d\u5668\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u540e\u9a8c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff08PCCS\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego-Exo4D\uff08\u81ea\u6211-\u5916\u90e8\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\uff09\u3001DAVIS-2017\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\u548cHANDAL-X\uff08\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u5e94\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V^2-SAM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u5e94\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation.

While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest.

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \\pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \\pm 0.113 to 0.993 \\pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \\pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \\pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3aT1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u5242\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6865\u5c0f\u8111\u89d2\u56ca\u80bf\u533a\u57df\u524d\u5ead\u795e\u7ecf\u9798\u7624\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b010%-30%\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5242\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11MRI\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5242\u91cf\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u60a3\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6865\u5c0f\u8111\u89d2\u56ca\u80bf\u533a\uff08\u5982\u524d\u5ead\u795e\u7ecf\u9798\u7624\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u75c5\u7076\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u752872\u540d\u524d\u5ead\u795e\u7ecf\u9798\u7624\u60a3\u8005203\u4e2aMRI\u7814\u7a76\uff08T1\u548cT1ce\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfT1ce\uff0810%-100%\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u5242\u91cfT1ce\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SSIM\uff09\u3001\u5cf0\u503c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08PSNR\uff09\u3001\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff08Dice\u300195% Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u9762\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u53ca\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u8f93\u5165\u5242\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6062\u590dT1ce\u7684SSIM\u4ece0.639\u00b10.113\u5347\u81f30.993\u00b10.009\uff0cPSNR\u4ece21.6\u00b13.73 dB\u5347\u81f341.4\u00b14.84 dB\u3002\u572810%\u8f93\u5165\u5242\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DL\u6062\u590dT1ce\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\u65f6\uff0cDice\u4ece0.673\u6539\u5584\u81f30.734\uff0c95% Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ece2.38 mm\u964d\u81f32.07 mm\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u9762\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ece1.00 mm\u964d\u81f30.59 mm\u300210%\u548c30%\u5242\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u5747\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u6865\u5c0f\u8111\u89d2\u56ca\u80bfMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f10%-30%\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5242\u91cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u75c5\u7076\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u5f81\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/semantic-anchors-icl", "summary": "Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a2\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.\n  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.\n  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (\"data\", \"poop\", \"loll\": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate).

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated.

We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($\u03ba= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale.

However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions.

We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMortgageLLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8f68\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u4eceLLaMA-3.1-8B\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5355\u4e00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8bddQ&A\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6307\u4ee4\u6b8b\u5dee\u6280\u672f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u9700\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08DPO\uff09\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u8f68\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u5bf9\u8bddQ&A\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6458\u8981\uff09\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u6b8b\u5dee\u6280\u672f\u6062\u590d\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMLM v2\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\uff1aLLM-as-a-Judge\u6458\u8981\u5206\u65704.58\uff08vs. 3.99\uff09\u3001Q&A 4.09\uff08vs. 4.0\uff09\u3001\u5206\u7c7b2.6\uff08vs. 1.2\uff09\uff1bBERTScore\u6458\u89810.77\uff08vs. 0.74\uff09\u3001Q&A 0.68\uff08vs. 0.58\uff09\u3001\u5206\u7c7b0.75\uff08vs. 0.73\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u6b8b\u5dee\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras.

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSGASA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u5e76\u5185\u5316\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u8bef\u62d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u89c4\u907f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f3a\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "method": "SGASA\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5408\u6210\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u4f7f\u7528SFT\u548cDPO\u5c06\u6307\u5357\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSGASA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SGASA\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u660e\u6717\u3002\u901a\u8fc78\u6570\u72ec puzzle\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u9988\u7565\u6709\u6539\u5584\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u8106\u5f31\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6210\u7ee9\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u51788\u6570\u72ec\u4efb\u52a1\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd54\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08AoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u5206\u7ea7\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u8def\u5f84\u5197\u957f\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u8fc2\u56de\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u9898\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6613\u788e\uff08\u65e0\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\u9891\u53d1\uff09\u548c\u5f31\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5faa\u73af\u6216\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction.

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u73b0\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0d\u5b9c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u6b63\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u80fd\u5426\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u663e\u793aLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u52a8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\uff08\u5982\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u4f73\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u6539\u5584\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u53d6\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7528\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f0f\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \\textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u7684\u65e0\u53cd\u6f14\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u5e76\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u70b9\u63d2\u503c\u878d\u5408\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u591a\u6837\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53e0\u52a0\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan.

Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts.

Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window.

However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at \u03b1=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether \"training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences.\" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u77ac\u65f6\u5355token\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c067B\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\uff080.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c6.7%\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0885%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c0%\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u6ce8\u5165\u201c\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eLindsey(2025)\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u7701\u89c9\u77e5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff08\u6700\u4f73~20%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u81ea\u62a5\u6ce8\u5165\u201c\u601d\u60f3\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u975e\u7b49\u5f85\u6d8c\u73b0\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6b64\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u201c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u7701\u662f\u5426\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u201d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u77ac\u65f6\u5355token\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf97B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u6ce8\u5165\u201c\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b85%\uff08held-out\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u03b1=40\uff09\uff0c0%\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff1b\u6ee1\u8db3Lindsey\u4e09\u6807\u51c6\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001 grounding\uff080/60\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff09\u3001internality\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u5148\u4e8everbalization\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u6cdb\u5316\uff087.5pp\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u5b9a\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u7701\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5185\u7f6eAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations.

In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration.

Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus.

Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops.

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context.

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08ST\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6307\u79f0\u8bcd\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u5316\u672f\u8bed\u94fe\u63a5\u56de\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u4ece\u9891\u8c31\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u97f3\u9ad8\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u97f3\u9ad8\u4f20\u8fbe\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4ST\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u5728\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5230\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed/\u6cd5\u8bed/\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7b49\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u8bef\u5224\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6027\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u5bdfen-es\u3001en-fr\u3001en-it\u4e09\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ILM\uff09\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8c31\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u7537\u6027\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bILM\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b66\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u9ad8\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u522b\u672f\u8bed\u5230\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u4ece\u9891\u7387\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u97f3\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793aST\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u8ffd\u6eaf\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u97f3\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance.

State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process.

Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMUSE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u60c5\u611f\u5408\u6210\uff08IES\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u60c5\u611f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274Test-Time Scaling\uff08TTS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4ee4\u724c\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4f55\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u673a\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u54ea\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u60c5\u611f\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c11\u56fa\u6709\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u60c5\u611f\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5b88\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u786e\u7acb\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5524\u8d77\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e38\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684IES\u65b9\u6cd5\u4eba\u4e3a\u5206\u79bb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u7597\u6cd5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u6545\u4e8b\u8bb2\u8ff0\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0eLLM\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u533a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684TTS\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u989d\u5916\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\uff1a\uff081\uff09HOW\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u4ee4\u724c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b\uff082\uff09WHEN\uff1a\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u673a\uff1b\uff083\uff09WHICH\uff1a\u591a\u60c5\u611f\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u6807\u60c5\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60c5\u611f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u60f3\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5b88\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "MUSE\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u5408\u6210\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning.

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset.

A reception experiment on Czech AI- and human-authored poetry", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship.

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye", "code_url": "https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye", "code_stars": 0, "code_last_update": "2025-11-08", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5e7f\u4e49\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u51653D-CNN\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4+ArcFace\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8679\u819c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6563\u7126\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff08\u5982\u4f59\u5f26\u6216L2\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u6cbf\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a3D-CNN\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u548cArcFace\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u57df\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8679\u819c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8679\u819c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties.

In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u539f\u7248\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEM-KD\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9logits\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u84b8\u998f\uff08VLAD\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\uff08VSD\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u635f\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5ffd\u7565\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1) \u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u89c6\u89c9logits\u7684\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) VLAD\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5e73\u6ed1L1\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b3) VSD\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9logits\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cEM-KD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\uff1b\u4e0e\u914d\u5907\u76f8\u540c\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5148\u524d\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EM-KD\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Entropy-Guided Adaptive Pruning for Diffusion and Flow Models", "comment": "Project page: https://github.com/changlin31/EntPruner", "summary": "Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance.

Project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/CtrlVDiff/", "summary": "We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.\n  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.\n  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCtrlVDiff\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5ea6\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u63d2\u5165\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MMVideo\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51e0\u4f55\u4ec5\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u7167\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u89e3\u6b67\u4e49\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "CtrlVDiff\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08HMCS\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u96c6\u8f93\u5165\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efaMMVideo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCtrlVDiff\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u4ea4\u6362\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u63d2\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CtrlVDiff\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

A Distractor-centric Empirical Analysis", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff08distractors\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u957f\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5f15\u5165Idis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u503c\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5728Waterbirds\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u9006\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u957f\u4f46\u65e0\u6548\uff09\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u68c0\u9a8c\u591a\u6a21\u6001VLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u662f\u5426\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIdis\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u503c\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff1b\u5206\u6790VLMs\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u4ee5\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5e72\u6270\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3Waterbirds\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u9006\u7f29\u653e\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff1b\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u8ffd\u8e2a\u663e\u793a\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u4e92\u52a8\uff1b\u5728Waterbirds\u4e0a\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u5728VLMs\u4e2d\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u5c5e\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output.

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%.

Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9VLA\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUPA-RFAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8865\u4e01\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u53casim-to-real\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "UPA-RFAS\uff08Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics\uff09\uff1a(i) \u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u21131\u504f\u5dee\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u6392\u65a5InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u793a\u504f\u79fb\uff1b(ii) \u9c81\u68d2\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5min-max\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u7528\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9\u6297\u786c\u5316\u90bb\u57df\uff1b(iii) VLA\u7279\u5b9a\u635f\u5931\uff1aPatch Attention Dominance\u52ab\u6301\u6587\u672c\u2192\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0cPatch Semantic Misalignment\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u591a\u6837VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cUPA-RFAS\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u89c6\u70b9\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u66b4\u9732VLA\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9645\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u672a\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relev\u00e9s. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBotaCLIP\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bDOFA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u690d\u7269\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u8bad\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5982\u751f\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "BotaCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u690d\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff08botanical relev\u00e9s\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u751f\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u690d\u7269\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8774\u8776\u53d1\u751f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u571f\u58e4\u8425\u517b\u7fa4\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBotaCLIP\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u4e8eDOFA\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u81f3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u4fed\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences.

Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity.

Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds.

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIFT-SNN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd0\u8f93\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SIFT\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u8f6c\u6362\u548cLIF SNN\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728Auckland Harbour Bridge\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b092.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c9.5ms\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8f93\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u6865\u6881\u548c\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u5c4f\u969c\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u529f\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408SIFT\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9a71\u52a8\u8109\u51b2\u8f6c\u6362\u5c42\u548cLIF SNN\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Auckland Harbour Bridge\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff086000\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u5e27\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f55\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738792.3%\uff08\u00b10.8%\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f49.5ms\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8109\u51b2\u6d3b\u52a88.1%\uff1b\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "SIFT-SNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81 grounding\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u5c4f\u969c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73b0\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%.

Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models.

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGGT\u9996\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad3D\u573a\u666f\u6240\u6709\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u5927\u573a\u666f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5934\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u5e76\uff08HTTM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u7c92\u5ea6token\u5408\u5e76\u52a0\u901fVGGT\uff0c\u8fbe7x\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "VGGT\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u573a\u666f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u4e00token\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fatoken\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "HTTM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u76843D token\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6309\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5934\u8fde\u63a5\u540etoken\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5934\u7ea7\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u5408\u5e76\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPU\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad87x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "HTTM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VGGT\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes.

Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting.

On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting.

While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models.

Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faE-M3RF\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b49\u53d8\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u91cd\u7ec4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u989c\u8272\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u788e\u7247\u91cd\u7ec4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\u514b\u670d\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e603D\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5c0f\u3001\u4fb5\u8680\u6216\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u65bd\u52a0\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u8f93\u5165\u788e\u7247\u70b9\u4e91\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e+\u989c\u8272\uff09\uff1b\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7531\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\u7531Transformer\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u7ec4\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728RePAIR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e23.1%\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e13.2%\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e18.4%\uff1b\u5728Breaking Bad\u3001Fantastic Breaks\u3001RePAIR\u548cPresious\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "E-M3RF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u91cd\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b49\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ADVLA \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u7834\u574f\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u6270\u52a8\u805a\u7126\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5e76\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u663e\u6270\u52a8\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "ADVLA \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u540e\u76f4\u63a5\u65bd\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7a00\u758f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982 Top-K \u63a9\u7801\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 L_\u221e=4/255 \u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Top-K \u63a9\u7801\u4ec5\u4fee\u6539 <10% \u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fd1 100%\uff1b\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5173\u952e\u533a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\uff1b\u5355\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ec5 0.06 \u79d2\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ADVLA \u5728\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u524a\u5f31 VLA \u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u660e\u663e\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u72ec\u7279\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb VLA \u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks.

To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility.

In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRFL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u53bb\u566a\u94fe\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u751f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faPRFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5168\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700VAE\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "PRFL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4RGB ReFL\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PRFL\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAVLight\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7167\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7UAV\u6cbf\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u591a\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6355\u83b7\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u7167\u660e\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u89c6\u70b9\u548c\u6807\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edfMVS/SfM\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u53d7\u7167\u660e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u9633\u5149\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u4e91\u906e\u3001\u9634\u5f71\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u989c\u8272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u5370\u8bb0\u3002UAV\u6237\u5916\u91cd\u5efa\u5c24\u751a\uff0c\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u7f3a\u7167\u660e\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u6216\u8de8\u5b63\u8282\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b64\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7167\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UAVLight\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u6cbf\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e00\u5929\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u7136\u7167\u660e\u53d8\u5f02\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6807\u5b9a\u548c\u89c6\u70b9\u3002\u914d\u5907\u8de8\u7167\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7167\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u6237\u59163D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "UAVLight\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5960\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling.

Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges.

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators.

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Canvas-to-Image\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u53c2\u8003\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u753b\u5e03\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408\u753b\u5e03\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u5b9a\u591a\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u590d\u5408\u753b\u5e03\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b curation \u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMulti-Task Canvas Training\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9075\u5b88\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4eba\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8de8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9-\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}
