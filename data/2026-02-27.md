TL;DR: 本研究通过TESS卫星的光晕光度测量方法，从98颗最亮恒星的不饱和光晕像素中提取光变曲线，揭示了包括红巨星、δ Scuti变星等在内的多种恒星变率，并测量了部分红巨星的振荡参数和恒星质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TESS卫星虽然为星震学、食双星等研究提供了便利，但由于最亮恒星容易饱和，限制了高分辨率研究。因此，研究者利用K2任务中的光晕光度方法，从TESS观测的最亮恒星中提取光变曲线，以填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用K2任务中的光晕光度测量技术，从TESS观测的98颗最亮恒星的不饱和光晕像素中提取光变曲线。使用pyMON工具测量红巨星的振荡参数（ν_max和Δν），并结合干涉测量和辐射测量数据计算恒星质量。

Result: 成功提取了98颗恒星的光变曲线，包括15颗红巨星、5颗δ Scuti变星等。测量了13颗红巨星的ν_max和1颗的Δν，并首次在其中5颗中检测到振荡。此外，还发现了α Cep的δ Scuti和γ Doradus变率、ε Car可能的星震双星特征，以及一颗新的食双星γ And。

Conclusion: 通过光晕光度方法，TESS数据可用于研究最亮恒星的变率和星震特征。结果不仅提供了丰富的观测数据，还为未来的PLATO和SONG任务提供了候选目标。

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $δ$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $ν_{\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $Δν$ for one of them, $β$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $ν_{\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $δ$ Scuti and $γ$ Doradus variability in $α$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $ε$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $γ$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

### [2] [Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22516)
*Wuming Yang,Shuya Dou,Xiangcun Meng,Yaqian Wu,Shaolan Bi*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文研究了银河系晕星中锂（Li）丰度的观测与理论预测之间的差异（宇宙学锂问题），通过引入旋转模型解释了Spite高原及其后续的Li丰度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测到的银河系晕星Li丰度（Spite高原）比标准大爆炸核合成（BBN）预测低约三倍，这一差异可能暗示新的物理或天体物理过程的存在。

Method: 采用包含引力沉降、扩散、旋转和磁场的模型，分析了恒星年龄、有效温度与Li丰度的关系。

Result: 旋转模型成功预测了Li高原及其随温度下降的Li丰度变化，与观测吻合，且初始Li丰度与BBN一致，表明Li问题源于恒星内部的Li耗散。

Conclusion: 旋转模型不仅解释了Spite高原的Li丰度，还能复现Li和Be的异常分布，支持恒星Li耗散是宇宙学Li问题的主要原因。

Abstract: The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0--2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy -- referred to as the cosmological Li problem -- is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8--13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0--2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个可靠且大规模的锂富集巨星样本，为未来恒星演化和锂富集研究提供了宝贵数据。

Abstract: Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 Å absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\rm{Li}) > 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages. This work presents a large and homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants derived from the LAMOST low-resolution survey, which provides a reliable and valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.

### [4] [A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614)

Conclusion: 孤立子在地磁暴早期的出现表明它们可能具有作为地磁活动增强的前兆潜力，为未来空间天气预警提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文分析了Sz 96和IP Tau行星形成盘中硅酸盐发射谱的变化，发现JWST观测到的谱线形状与20年前的SST数据相比有明显变化，推测这是由于盘内部结构的改变以及结晶硅酸盐向外传输导致的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究行星形成盘中硅酸盐发射谱的长期变化，以理解盘中矿物组成和温度分布的动态演变。

Method: 使用JWST对Sz 96和IP Tau进行观测，并与20年前的SST数据进行对比，分析光谱变化及结晶硅酸盐的温度分布。

Result: Sz 96在短波长（≤18μm）处变暗，而IP Tau在所有波长处变亮，尤其在10μm附近增强明显。结晶硅酸盐的温度低于非晶硅酸盐，支持结晶颗粒从内向外传输的假设。

Conclusion: 盘中硅酸盐发射谱的变化反映了内部结构的动态调整，JWST的高分辨率为结晶硅酸盐的研究提供了更清晰的证据。

Abstract: Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18~$\mathrm{μm}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\mathrm{μm}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.

### [6] [Automated Identification of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in Globular Clusters with Gaia Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22682)
*Yi Yang,Zhenzhen Shao,Xiaofeng Wang,Xiaochen Zheng*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种自动识别球状星团中红巨星分支尖端（TRGB）的方法，结合天文数据和算法，提高了识别效率并扩展了TRGB样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TRGB识别方法效率较低，且样本数量有限，需要一种自动化方法来提高识别效率和准确性。

Method: 使用160个球状星团的Gaia数据和Python脚本生成CMDs，通过LOF算法去除异常值，并用二次多项式拟合RGB，最终识别TRGB。

Result: 扩展了TRGB样本至91个，发现I波段光度随金属丰度增加的递减趋势，TRGB的$\rm M_{I}$约为$-$4.02。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可靠，为天文数据分析中自动化工具的开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This study introduces an automated approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, combining astronomical data with algorithmic methods. Using a dataset of 160 globular clusters and Python scripts, we matched stellar sources with Gaia data. Our script generates color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and uses the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers. Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity. Our approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency while providing valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis.

### [7] [Statistical Study of Rapid Blue Excursions as Mass Conduits in Solar Atmosphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22811)
*Govindswaroop Rahangdale*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: RBEs（快速蓝偏移）是短暂蓝移色球吸收特征，被认为是Ⅱ型太阳针状体的对映体。通过高时间分辨率光谱观测和自动检测算法分析其动态特性，结果显示RBEs寿命短（平均75秒）、速度范围大（20-140 km/s），且是色球向日冕输送物质的重要通道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RBEs的动态特性，以明确其在色球-日冕耦合中的作用及其作为物质传输通道的重要性。

Method: 采用高时间分辨率光谱观测，结合自动检测和时空跟踪算法，通过蓝翼多普勒不对称标准识别RBEs，并利用空间连通性和质心连续性方法追踪其寿命和运动学演化。

Result: RBEs寿命主要在20-60秒之间，平均约75秒；速度范围20-140 km/s，平均26 km/s；长度1.2-5.5 Mm；局部磁足点表现出重复活动；质量通量估计表明RBEs向日冕输送大量等离子体。

Conclusion: RBEs是动态物质传输通道，对色球-日冕耦合起关键作用。

Abstract: Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) are transient blue-shifted chromospheric absorption features widely interpreted as the on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules. We investigate their dynamic properties using high-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms. RBEs were identified through blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria and tracked using spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods to determine lifetimes and kinematic evolution. The statistical analysis shows that RBEs are short-lived events with lifetimes predominantly between 20 to 60 s and a mean duration of approximately 75 s. The lifetime distribution follows an exponential decay profile, indicative of impulsive driving. Line-of-sight velocities range from 20 to 140 km s-1, with a mean near 26 km s-1. Projected lengths span 1.2-5.5 Mm with sub-arcsecond widths, and recurrence analysis reveals repeated activity at localized magnetic footpoints. Mass flux estimates suggest that RBEs transport significant plasma upward, contributing to chromospheric mass supply toward the corona. These findings reinforce the role of RBEs as dynamic conduits of mass transfer and key elements in chromosphere-corona coupling.

### [8] [Detection of circumstellar disks around nearby young brown dwarf candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22832)
*N. Phan-Bao,M. S. Bessell,E. L. Martín*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 该研究旨在探测和研究年轻恒星附近晚型M和棕矮星的星周盘，揭示它们和围绕它们的岩石行星的形成过程，同时检测23个候选天体中的星周盘，21个为褐矮星候选体，2颗为极低质量恒星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测和研究晚型M和棕矮星周围的星周盘，有助于理解这些极低质量天体的形成机制及其周围岩石行星的形成过程，同时验证新的年轻极低质量天体及其星周盘。

Method: 研究人员使用DENIS、2MASS和WISE的光度数据以及Gaia的视差数据构建了3928个候选体的光谱能量分布，并通过红外超检测星周盘；随后通过光谱观测寻找锂元素确认其年轻性质，并通过H_alpha发射线检测吸积活动。

Result: 在3928个候选体中发现了23个具有星周盘的天体，其中10个为新发现；21个为褐矮星候选体，2颗为极低质量恒星。DENIS J0534552-104808可能是猎户座D云前的前景天体成员。光谱观测发现11个天体有锂元素存在，检测到7个吸积体和1个潜在吸积体。

Conclusion: 研究支持极低质量天体周围可能存在岩石行星的观点，DENIS-P J0500245-333042的高吸积活动为这一观点提供了进一步证据。

Abstract: It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.

*S. Bellotti,C. Pezzotti,G. Buldgen,A. A. Vidotto,D. Evensberget,E. Magaudda*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了GJ 504星的磁场和恒星风特性，提出其快速自转和活跃磁活动可能是由于吞噬了一颗近距木星质量行星所致，并通过观测和模拟验证了这一假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GJ 504星的自转周期短且磁活动强烈，与其演化阶段不符。研究试图通过分析其磁场和恒星风，验证行星吞噬是否是其异常的物理原因。

Method: 利用ESPaDOnS光谱偏振观测和Zeeman-Doppler成像技术重建GJ 504的大尺度磁场，通过3D MHD模拟恒星风和角动量损失，并与有/无行星吞噬的演化模型对比。

Result: 发现GJ 504的磁场为偶极非轴对称结构，强度5.3 G。模拟显示行星吞噬可解释其自转速度和X射线亮度等观测限制。HD 75332可能是另一个类似案例。

Conclusion: 行星吞噬是GJ 504异常特性的合理解释，该现象可能不孤立，为研究恒星-行星相互作用提供了新的观测依据。

Abstract: With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\rm \dot{J}$). We then compared $\rm \dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\rm \dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.

Conclusion: DF Tau主星的吸积过程与孤立恒星类似，但磁场拓扑的差异暗示了吸积对磁场演化或伴星捕获的潜在影响。

Abstract: The accretion process in young stellar objects (YSOs) is fundamental to the formation of stellar systems. This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. We also identified a significant difference in the magnetic topology of the two stars querying the influence of accretion of the evolution of the magnetic field, or capture of the secondary star.

### [11] [Searching for low-mass stars with magnetically-induced hyper-inflated radii](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23147)
*D. J. Mullan,J. MacDonald*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 某些低质量恒星的半径相对于理论预测存在膨胀现象，特别是在磁性活跃的恒星中。本文通过分析克卜勒望远镜观测的44对食双星数据，探讨是否存在超膨胀恒星的证据，并使用磁对流模型估算了内部磁场强度的上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解低质量恒星半径膨胀现象，尤其是磁性活跃恒星中的超膨胀现象，并验证磁对流模型对这种现象的解释能力。

Method: 分析克卜勒望远镜观测的44对食双星的测光数据（Cruz et al. 研究），结合磁对流模型计算内部磁场强度的上限（Bc）。

Result: 研究发现，质量大于∼0.6太阳质量的恒星中，平均膨胀现象可通过Bc≈10 kG的内部磁场解释；而质量小于0.4太阳质量的恒星可能接近超膨胀状态，需要Bc≈100-300 kG的更强磁场。

Conclusion: 研究提示了低质量恒星中超膨胀现象的可能性，但需通过高分辨率光谱进一步验证。磁对流模型为解释这种现象提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Precise empirical estimates of stellar radii have revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions: the largest inflations occur in magnetically active stars. Theoretically, the radii of magnetically active stars are in some cases found to be 'hyper-inflated' to roughly double the radius of a non-magnetic star with equal mass. Here we ask, do data exist which could allow us to search for empirical evidence in support of hyper-inflated stars? A photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may help us in our search. The Cruz et al. study, although subject to large uncertainties, hints at the presence of hyper-inflation in some of the 88 stars in their sample. Their data enable us to set theoretical limits on the maximum strength Bc of magnetic fields inside their sample stars. According to our magneto-convective model, the average empirical inflations found from analysis of the Cruz et al. data can be replicated if Bc approx. 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than ~ 0.6 MSun. On the other hand, in stars with masses less than about 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the average empirical inflations of the stars may approach hyper-inflated status. Such stars may require significantly stronger internal fields, i.e. Bc approx. 100-300 kG. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Kepler binaries could help to confirm or refute our conclusions.

Motivation: 由于早期对低FIP元素的分馏研究结论存在矛盾，中等FIP元素（如硫）可能提供额外的诊断信息，因为它们的分馏过程可能涉及不同于低FIP物种的机制。论文旨在通过研究羽流中硫的分馏现象、其演化及其与波活动的关系，进一步理解等离子体特性和磁连通性。

Method: 利用Solar Orbiter在2024年3月至4月期间对赤道日冕洞中两个羽流的观测数据，结合SPICE光谱成像技术，推导硫氮比。同时辅以EUV成像和磁力图提供上下文支持。数据处理采用开源Python工具SAFFRON进行光谱分析和噪声降低。

Result: 研究发现，两个羽流的硫分馏现象在误差范围内保持稳定，且分馏等离子体与强磁足点共存，这与周围的羽间等离子体形成对比。

Conclusion: 结果为羽流中硫分馏现象提供了直接证据，并支持了chromosphere中波动力学驱动的ponderomotive力模型假说。

Abstract: Coronal plumes are bright, narrow structures rooted in coronal holes that contribute to the solar wind. Their composition, particularly elemental fractionation as a function of first ionization potential (FIP), provides diagnostics of plasma properties and magnetic connectivity. Earlier plume studies of fractionation using low-FIP elements reached conflicting conclusions. Intermediate-FIP elements may provide additional diagnostic insight, since their fractionation is thought to involve processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species. We investigate sulfur (intermediate-FIP element) in plumes to assess the presence of fractionation, its evolution, and its relation to wave activity. We analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March--April 2024, using Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) to derive the sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. EUV imaging and magnetograms provided additional context. Data were processed with the open-source Python tool Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise (SAFFRON). Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, in contrast with the surrounding interplume plasma. These results provide the evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, wave dynamics in the chromosphere as a driver.

### [13] [Tidal Synchronization of Binaries in Pleiades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23251)
*Li Wang,Chenyu He,Chengyuan Li,Gang Li*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了仙女座星团（Pleiades）中双星系统的潮汐同步现象，发现轨道周期短于8.6天的双星系统中存在7个潮汐同步系统，而较长周期的系统通常表现为超同步且偏心率较高。同步和轨道圆化的临界周期接近，且同步度与质量比相关性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双星系统中的潮汐相互作用对长期自转和轨道演化至关重要，但关于星团中双星同步现象的观测数据有限。本研究旨在利用Gaia DR3、K2任务和光谱数据，评估仙女座星团中双星的潮汐同步程度。

Method: 结合Gaia DR3的星团成员数据、K2任务的自转周期以及长期光谱调查的轨道解，通过比较伪同步周期和主星自转周期，评估了42个双星的同步度。

Result: 发现7个轨道周期短于8.6天的潮汐同步系统（1个早型、6个晚型）。较长周期系统多为超同步且偏心率较高。同步和轨道圆化的临界周期接近（~8.6-14天），且同步度与质量比相关性更强。

Conclusion: 仙女座星团中潮汐同步与圆化的临界周期相似，同步现象更多依赖于质量比而非主星质量。早型双星受潮汐制动影响显著，而晚型双星的自转更接近单星序列。

Abstract: Tidal interactions in close binaries play a key role in the long-term rotational and orbital evolution. The distributions of circularization across open clusters (OCs) place strong observational constraints on tidal dissipation in binaries. However, direct observational constraints on synchronization among binaries in OCs remain limited. For the 125 Myr OC Pleiades, this work combines cluster membership from Gaia Data Release 3, rotation periods from the K2 mission, and orbital solutions of the binary population from a long-term spectroscopic survey, to investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the pseudo-synchronization period to the rotation period of the primary stars. Among 42 binaries with reliable orbital periods Porb and rotation periods, we identify seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb < 8.6 days, including one early-type system and six late-type systems. For binaries with longer Porb, primaries generally are super-synchronized, and most systems are eccentric. We find a synchronization transition near Porb ~ 8.6-14 days, comparable to the known circularization period (Porb ~ 7.2 days) in the Pleiades, which suggests similar critical period scales for synchronization and circularization in this coeval population. Synchronization depends much more strongly on mass ratio than on primary mass. Most synchronized systems in Pleiades have high mass ratios and are likely to evolve into double white dwarf systems. Tides likely impose strong rotational braking on close early-type binaries, while their influence on late-type close binaries is weaker, and their spins largely follow the single-star sequence.

Result: 白矮星附近的戴森球发射更冷且在近红外和中红外波段峰值，红矮星附近的戴森球辐射更强但波长更长；两种情况下，平衡温度随半径增加按R_D^-1/2下降，而总光度和观测到的辐射通量由恒星输出固定。

Conclusion: 低光度恒星（如白矮星和红矮星）是建造戴森球的潜在适合宿主，研究结果为未来红外巡天的技术特征搜索提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The construction of Dyson spheres, megastructures designed to capture the total radiative output of stars, can be one of the most compelling techno-signature scenarios for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. By considering equilibrium temperatures, we investigate the luminosities and fluxes of Dyson spheres built around two promising classes of host stars: white dwarfs and red M-dwarfs. Using radiative balance arguments and representative stellar parameters, we compute the temperature-radius relationship for full energy interception and place these hypothetical structures on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram to assess their observational signatures. Our results show that Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler and fainter blackbody emissions, peaking in the near- to mid-infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths. In both cases, the equilibrium temperature decreases as R_ D^-1/2, while the total luminosity and observed bolometric flux remain fixed by the stellar output. These findings highlight the astrophysical suitability of low-luminosity stars as Dyson sphere hosts and provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.

### [15] [JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Sub-Neptune HD 15337 c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22327)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究了HD 15337 c（TOI-402.02）的3-5 µm透射光谱，发现其光谱无特征，可能是高金属丰度和/或高空气溶胶所致，支持了近期关于气溶胶不透明度的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过JWST观测数据，探索HD 15337 c的大气特性，验证其高金属丰度或气溶胶存在的可能性。

Method: 使用两个管道减少JWST COMPASS程序的观测数据，并通过热化学平衡检索分析大气成分。

Result: 透射光谱无特征，表明大气金属丰度高或存在气溶胶；数据排除了金属丰度低于600或310倍太阳值的情况。

Conclusion: HD 15337 c与其他类似行星一样，具有高金属丰度或气溶胶，支持了气溶胶不透明度在500-700 K行星中达到最大值的假设。

Abstract: We present the 3-5 $μ$m transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c (TOI-402.02), a sub-Neptune (2.526 R$_{\oplus}$, 6.792 M$_{\oplus}$, T$_{\rm eq}$$\sim$656 K) around a K1V star observed as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We reduce these observations with two pipelines and find consistent transmission spectra. The resulting median precisions in 30 pixel spectroscopic bins for visit 1 are $\sim$40 ppm and $\sim$70 ppm and for visit 2 are $\sim$30 ppm and $\sim$54 ppm for NRS1 and NRS2, respectively. We attribute the differing precisions to the lack of adequate pre-transit baseline in visit 1 from an early transit arrival caused by previously undetected transit timing variations (TTVs), hinting at a potential exterior companion. Our median JWST timing precision is 10 seconds, revealing TTVs $>$20 minutes when combined with previous TESS and CHEOPS data, highlighting JWST's TTV measurement capabilities. The transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c is featureless and can best be described by a step function with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, likely caused by instrumental systematics. From thermochemical equilibrium retrievals we find that, to $>$3$σ$, the data can rule out atmospheres with metallicities $<$600 or $<$310 $\times$ solar, depending on the reduction, for opaque pressures greater than a few millibars. HD 15337 c joins other sub-Neptunes with similar masses, radii, and temperatures in possessing a featureless transmission spectrum indicative of high metallicity and/or high-altitude aerosols and adds support to recent studies showing that aerosol opacity reaches a maximum for planets with equilibrium temperatures of 500-700 K.

TL;DR: 利用JWST/NIRSpec G395H观测TOI-260 b的透射光谱，发现光谱基本无特征，但可能在3.17μm处存在潜在特征。大气金属度约束高于200倍太阳值，但未检测到明确分子信号。推测3.17μm特征可能源于系统误差。

Result: 光谱基本无特征，金属度约束高于200倍太阳值，3.17μm特征可能源于系统误差。

Conclusion: TOI-260 b的大气组成尚未明确，需更多观测时间以揭示其真实性质。

Abstract: We present a JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of TOI-260 b, a $T_\mathrm{eq}\sim 490$ K, $R_\mathrm{p} = 1.76\,R_\oplus$ planet. The transmission spectrum is derived by combining two transit observations, collected as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We achieved the same median transit depth precision of 37 ppm in both visits, and a median precision of 26 ppm when combining the spectroscopic light curves from the two visits. Implementing a 30-pixel-wide ($R\sim 200$) spectroscopic binning scheme, we find that the transmission spectrum is mostly featureless, with a possible feature around 3.17 $μ$m. We assess the significance of any features in the transmission spectrum with a suite of non-parametric models, which confirm the presence of a potential feature in the NRS1 bandpass and an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors. To investigate the atmospheric composition of TOI-260 b, we run a series of PLATON retrievals. We do not detect any clear molecular signatures, but the combined data from the two visits are sufficient to constrain the atmospheric metallicity to greater than $200\times$ solar, assuming no opaque deck $\lesssim2.5$ mbar. We also investigate causes of the potential feature near 3.17 $μ$m; while we find some compatible gaseous species and cannot fully discard an astrophysical origin, we suspect a systematics origin due to the variance in strength and position of the feature. Overall, this look at TOI-260 b adds to the small sample of radius-valley planets, which already seem to show a diversity in their atmospheric compositions. Determining the true nature of these enigmatic planets will require a larger telescope time investment.

Abstract: We present a major update to the open-source atmospheric modeling package \texttt{PICASO}, designed for simulating the thermal structure and spectra of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This release, \texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.

Abstract: Planet formation theories suggest the presence of free-floating planets (FFPs) that are ejected from their formation sites. While these planets emit very little light, they can be identified through gravitational microlensing. Here, we report the discovery of a FFP candidate in the microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-3237. The observed light curve exhibits strong finite-source effects characterized by a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.9\,{\rm mag})$ and a short timescale $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$. The analysis yields an Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} = 0.54\pm0.02\,{\rm days}$ and an angular Einstein radius of $θ_{\rm E} = 6.30\pm0.48\,μ{\rm as}$. The measurements make it possible to estimate the lens mass as $M \simeq 102\,M_{\oplus}\,(π_{\rm rel}/16\,μ{\rm as})^{-1}$, where $π_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. Depending on the unknown $π_{\rm rel}$, the lens could be a Neptune-mass planet $(π_{\rm rel} \simeq 0.1\,{\rm mas})$ or a Saturn-mass planet $(π_{\rm rel} \simeq 16\,μ{\rm as})$. A Bayesian analysis yields the lens mass $M = {67.3}_{-42.5}^{+103.2}\,M_{\oplus}$ and the lens distance $D_{\rm L} = {7.34}_{-2.11}^{+0.96}\,{\rm kpc}$. This lens is the eleventh isolated microlens with a measurement of $θ_{\rm E} < 10\,μ{\rm as}$. We find that additional searches for possible signatures of a lens host do not show significant evidence for the host.

Conclusion: 该方法为Gaia DR3全小行星样本提供了完全概率分类目录，为研究主带组成结构、识别家族成员及与陨石群关联提供了资源，并为未来Gaia版本（如DR4）的验证建立了方法框架。

Abstract: We present a supervised, probabilistic taxonomic classification of asteroid reflectance spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). Using high-quality Gaia DR3 spectra and a reference set of spectra from the literature consisting exclusively of asteroids with robust spectroscopic taxonomic types, we construct a principal-component (PC) representation of the Gaia reflectances. For each major spectral complex (C, S, X) and several end-member classes (B, D, A, L, K, V), we model the distribution of reference objects in PC space using multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE). This yields likelihoods for each spectral class and provides a quantitative measure of classification confidence.
  Validation against a sample of objects with known spectral classes demonstrates good performance for classes with distinctive reflectance signatures, including the S-complex, D, V, and A types. Spectrally continuous classes (B-C-complex, K-L-S-complex, and X-complex) show the expected degrees of mixing given the limited wavelength range of Gaia's spectrophotometry. We further explore the compositional structure of six major asteroid collisional families using our Gaia-derived spectral classes, finding excellent agreement with ground-based spectroscopy and revealing enhanced detections of olivine-rich A type material in the Flora and Eunomia families, as well as new insights into the spectral diversity of the Tirela family.
  The resulting catalogue constitutes a fully probabilistic taxonomic classification for the full Gaia DR3 asteroid sample. It offers a resource for studying the compositional structure of the main belt, identifying family interlopers, and linking asteroid populations to meteorite groups, and establishes a methodological framework for future Gaia releases, in particular for the validation of the Gaia DR4, expected by the end of 2026.

Motivation: 研究HRCCS技术结合下一代设施ELT/ANDES能否稳健探测长周期亚海王星的轨道参数和大气信号，并量化外凌日观测对信号恢复的影响。

Method: 使用Ratri管道模拟YJH波段的透射观测数据，并通过HRCCS框架Upamana进行分析，注入符合HST/Spitzer/JWST约束的大气信号，探索不同C/O比模型的敏感性。

Result: 外凌日数据的加入显著提升信号探测能力，但需在互相关前对模板模型进行预处理；V1298Tau b的H2O、H2S和CO可在10小时内检测到；TOI-451c的C/O比区分需18小时以上。

Conclusion: HRCCS与ELT/ANDES结合将成为探测年轻长周期亚海王星大气多样性的关键工具。

Abstract: High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting and characterizing exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. While it has been highly successful for ultra-hot Jupiters and hot Jupiters, next-generation facilities such as ELT/ANDES will extend its reach to smaller and longer-period planets, including young sub-Neptunes and their progenitors. We investigate whether HRCCS with ELT/ANDES can robustly recover orbital parameters and atmospheric signals of the long-period sub-Neptunes V1298Taub and TOI-451c. For such systems, the slow Doppler drift of the planetary signal over a single night reduces its separation from stationary telluric contamination, increasing the risk of signal removal while detrending. We therefore quantify the impact of including out-of-transit exposures on signal recovery and parameter estimation. We simulate transmission observations in the YJH bands using the Ratri pipeline and analyze them with the HRCCS framework Upamana. For V1298Taub, we inject atmospheric signals consistent with HST, Spitzer, and JWST constraints. For TOI-451c, we explore models spanning sub-solar to super-solar C/O ratios to assess compositional sensitivity. We find that incorporating out-of-transit exposures significantly enhances detectability, provided that the detrending effects are consistently propagated to the template models prior to cross-correlation. Without this reprocessing step, recovered orbital parameters can deviate substantially from injected values or yield reduced detection significance. For V1298Tau b, >5$σ$ detections of H2O, H2S, and CO are achievable within $\lesssim$10 hours (~2 nights). For TOI-451c, distinguishing sub-solar from super-solar C/O ratios requires $\geq$18 hours. HRCCS with ELT/ANDES will therefore be a key tool for probing the atmospheric diversity of young, long-period sub-Neptunes in the ELT era.

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一个基于均匀LAMOST光谱的小规模可靠碎片盘候选体样本，为未来研究碎片盘演化和恒星活动奠定了基础。

Abstract: Warm debris disks around main-sequence stars trace late-stage terrestrial planet formation. Motivated by the need for systematic searches of such systems, we identify debris disk candidates around FGK stars within 150 pc by combining a spectroscopically selected sample from LAMOST DR12 with Gaia astrometry and multi-band infrared photometry. Infrared excesses are identified through SED fitting and validated using conservative, source-by-source checks. This approach yields a final sample of 12 debris disk candidates including ten new detections. Stellar age research indicate that most of the host stars are several billion years old. NEOWISE monitoring reveals no significant W1/W2 variability, consistent with a circumstellar origin of the infrared excess. while a search for co-moving companions using Gaia DR3 reveals possible companions for only two candidates at very large projected separations ($\gtrsim 10^4$~au). Three candidates exhibit excess emission in both the W3 and W4 bands, allowing estimates of characteristic dust properties. This work establishes a small yet reliable sample of debris disk candidates anchored in homogeneous LAMOST spectroscopy, providing a foundation for future studies of debris disk evolution and stellar activity.

Method: 利用N体模拟分析行星半径和偏心率与其前身原行星质量和轨道构型的关系，特别关注初始萨夫罗诺夫数的影响。

Result: 在两类行星系统中，岩石与冰质原行星的能量均分导致偏心率的显著差异，表现为半径谷附近的峰值；单一行星系统则无此特征，支持迷你海王星中水世界的存在。

Conclusion: 观测到的半径和偏心率分布可能反映了三类系统的混合：纯岩石行星、以冰质行星为主的行星系统，以及两者兼具的系统。

Abstract: While recent planet-formation models broadly reproduce the observed population of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, as well as the bimodal radius distribution (the ``radius valley''), it remains unclear whether all these planets share a common rocky composition (a single popoulation of planets) or instead comprise two distinct populations -- rocky planets and icy planets (two populations of planets). The inferred eccentricity-radius relation, which shows a modest peak near the radius valley, provides a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between these scenarios. Here we use N-body simulations to examine how the radii and eccentricities of close-in planets depend on the masses and orbital configurations of their progenitor protoplanets. We find that final planetary eccentricities scale with the system initial Safronov number. In two-population systems, energy equipartition between rocky and relatively more massive icy protoplanets creates a strong eccentricity contrast between the two groups, which appears as a peak near the radius valley. This signature does not appear if planetary systems are composed exclusively of rocky planets (with or without H-rich atmospheres), as assumed in photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Because the eccentricity-radius relation traces a dichotomy in the underlying protoplanet mass distribution -- most plausibly arising from formation at different disk locations -- our results suggest that a significant fraction of mini-Neptunes are water-worlds. The observed radius and eccentricity distributions may reflect a mixture of systems that host exclusively rocky planets, systems dominated by icy planets, and systems with both rocky and icy planets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中晚期M矮星周围行星的分布和特性，以了解行星形成与恒星质量的关系，尤其是验证Radius Valley消失的预测。

Method: 使用定制管道分析TESS观测的8134颗中晚期M矮星数据，通过注入-恢复方法表征探测灵敏度，并测量行星的发生率及其特性（轨道周期、辐射量和半径）。

Result: 测得每颗恒星在30天内轨道半径>1R⊕的行星累积发生率为1.10±0.16；半径分布为单峰（峰值1.25±0.05R⊕），超级地球比例远高于次海王星（5.5:1），支持Radius Valley消失现象。

Conclusion: M矮星是小质量近轨行星的主要宿主，Radius Valley在其周围消失的现象与富水微吸积模型一致，表明次海王星可能是富含水的行星。

Abstract: We present the deepest systematic search for planets around mid-to-late M dwarfs to date. We have surveyed 8134 mid-to-late M dwarfs observed by TESS with a custom built pipeline and recover 77 vetted transiting planet candidates. We characterize the sensitivity of our survey via injection-recovery and measure the occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period, instellation, and planet radius. We measure a cumulative occurrence rate of $1.10\pm0.16$ planets per star with radii $>1\, R_\oplus$ orbiting within 30 days. This value is consistent with the cumulative occurrence rate around early M dwarfs, making M dwarfs collectively the most prolific hosts of small close-in planets. Unlike the bimodal Radius Valley exhibited by close-in planet population around FGK and early M dwarfs, we recover a unimodal planet radius distribution peaking at $1.25\pm0.05 \, R_\oplus$. We additionally find $0.954\pm0.147$ super-Earths and $0.148\pm0.045$ sub-Neptunes per star, with super-Earths outnumbering sub-Neptunes 5.5:1, firmly demonstrating that the Radius Valley disappears around the lowest mass stars. The dearth of sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs is consistent with predictions from water-rich pebble accretion models that predict a fading Radius Valley with decreasing stellar mass. Our results support the emerging idea that the sub-Neptune population around M dwarfs is composed of water-rich worlds. We find no hot Jupiters in our survey and set an upper limit of 0.012 hot Jupiters per mid-to-late M dwarf within 10 days.

TL;DR: 该论文报道了对重复快速射电暴FRB 20220529A的发现及为期3.2年的监测，观测到其色散量逐渐下降、散射时间尺度变化、局部磁场强度高，支持其源于年轻超新星遗迹的假说。

Motivation: 研究FRB 20220529A的环境特性，揭示其可能的物理起源和周围介质的动态变化。

Method: 通过CHIME/FRB设备进行为期3.2年的监测，分析色散量、法拉第旋转量、偏振及射电谱的变化。

Result: 观测到色散量下降、磁场强度高达3.4 mG、偏振分数随频率降低而减小，并限制其持久射电源的谱光度上限。

Conclusion: FRB 20220529A可能源于年轻的超新星遗迹，环境动态变化可能与遗迹或双星伴星相互作用有关。

Abstract: We present the discovery and subsequent 3.2 year monitoring campaign of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20220529A with CHIME/FRB. We observe a gradual dispersion measure (DM) decline of $-0.881\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ ($-1.235\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ in the rest frame), implying a $\geq3.5\pm0.2$% decrease of the total electron column in the source environment, and we see scattering timescale variations over weeks to years. We observe a short-lived excursion in which the DM rises by $\sim 1~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, immediately preceding a transient $\sim 2000~\mathrm{rad}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ Faraday rotation measure (RM) increase previously reported for this source, before returning to its gradual DM decline. We identify a local line-of-sight magnetic field around FRB 20220529A during this DM/RM excursion of $3.4 \pm 0.2~\mathrm{mG}$, corresponding to one of the most strongly magnetized FRB environments. We measure a decrease in the linear polarization fraction of FRB 20220529A bursts with decreasing frequency that we attribute to depolarization from multi-path propagation in the source environment. We also place a $5σ$ upper limit on the spectral luminosity of an associated persistent radio source of $\leq 5\times10^{28}~\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz. These observations are consistent with FRB 20220529A originating from a young ($\sim$ years to centuries old) expanding supernova remnant, with short-lived DM and RM variability arising from interactions with the supernova remnant or with a binary companion.

### [26] [Unveiling the X-ray properties of the eclipsing Cataclysmic Variable UU Aqr: spatially and spectrally-resolved two-component emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22337)
*Nazma Islam,Koji Mukai,Maurice A. Leutenegger,Gabriel W. Pratt*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper identifies a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV, detecting total eclipses in hard X-rays but not in soft X-rays. Hard X-rays originate near the WD's boundary layer, while soft X-rays come from an extended region, likely shocks in accretion-disk winds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of X-ray components in non-magnetic CVs, particularly distinguishing between hard and soft X-ray emissions and their spatial distribution.

Method: Used Chandra, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton observations to detect eclipses, performed detailed modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis, and broadband spectral modeling.

Result: Hard X-rays originate from a compact region near the WD (boundary layer), while soft X-rays come from an extended region, likely shocks in accretion-disk winds. Neither scattered hard X-rays nor colliding winds explain the soft emission.

Conclusion: Soft X-ray emission in UU Aqr is produced by shocks in vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. New estimates for WD and donor star parameters are provided.

Abstract: Non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) show two distinct X-ray components: a hard, optically thin component and a soft, optically thick, blackbody-like component, both produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the White Dwarf (WD). An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. We also provide new estimates on the emitting regions, mass and radius of the WD and the donor star using eclipse modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了γ射线发射的窄线赛弗特I型星系（γ-NLSy1）的光学发射特性，通过长期观测分析其通量和颜色变异性，探讨了吸积盘与喷流之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: γ-NLSy1是研究吸积盘与喷流耦合的理想系统，其软X射线特性表明存在光学/紫外波段的吸积盘成分。研究光学发射有助于进一步理解这些系统的物理过程及其与耀变体的联系。

Method: 利用ZTF的长期观测数据，分析了g和r波段的光学通量及颜色变异性（如F_var和ψ值），并通过颜色-星等图、变时标（t_var）以及PSD分析（DRW和CARMA模型）探讨了发射区尺度和物理时标。

Result: 研究发现γ-NLSy1的通量变异性高达72%（均值23%），颜色-星等图表现出与耀变体相似的趋势。变时标显示发射区尺度为10^{15-17} cm，PSD分析揭示了与吸积盘热/粘滞时标或喷流能量耗散相关的特征时标（几天至数百天）。这些结果支持了盘-喷流连接的假设。

Conclusion: γ-NLSy1的光学变异性及特征时标与吸积盘和喷流的物理过程密切相关，进一步验证了盘-喷流耦合的存在。变时标与黑洞质量的关系也与前人研究一致，为理解此类系统的动力学提供了新线索。

Abstract: The $γ$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert-I ($γ$-NLSy1) are among the most interesting systems for studying disk-jet coupling. The soft X-ray properties of these systems suggest the presence of a disc component, which peaks in the optical/UV regime, in addition to the active jet. In this work, we investigate the optical emission from $γ$-NLSy1 using long-term Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations and discussed in the context of blazars. We have reported the long-term flux and color variability in the g- and r-bands. The fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) goes as high as 72\%, with a mean value of 23\%, while the amplitude of variability ($ψ$) values range from 0.24 to 3.20, which is consistent with the long-term Swift-UVOT variability studies. The color-magnitude diagrams exhibit an RWB or BWB trend similar to that of blazars. The $t_{\rm var}$ suggests an emitting region size of $10^{15-17}$ cm, aligned with emissions coming from the inner accretion disk or base of the jet. The PSD analysis using both DRW and CARMA modeling exhibits a characteristic break timescale of a few days to hundreds of days, which is likely linked to fundamental physical timescales in the system, such as thermal or viscous timescales in the accretion disk or timescales for acceleration and energy dissipation in the jet. The existence of these timescales acts as another signature of the disc-jet connection. These time scales are correlated with black hole mass, and the relation is consistent with previous studies.

Motivation: 研究中子星引力波$ω$模式光谱，为理解其内部致密物质（夸克性物质）的物理特性提供了电磁观测无法实现的窗口。

Method: 利用相对论平均场理论（RMF）的G3和IOPB-I参数化，构建由夸克性物质核心和强子物质外壳组成的多组分恒星内部分布，并计算其$ω$模式的复特征频率。

Result: 研究发现夸克性物质的结构产生了独特的$ω$模式特征，不同于纯强子或混合星体，且振荡频率和阻尼时间表现出对状态方程的强烈依赖性。同时揭示了与状态方程无关的普适关系。

Conclusion: 夸克性星的$ω$模式特征提供了探测中子星内部物质结构的新方法，其普适关系可能简化未来观测数据的解释。

Abstract: The gravitational wave $ω$ mode spectrum presents a unique window into the dense interior of neutron stars, probing physics inaccessible to electromagnetic observations. This work investigates the $ω$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($Λ_{\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $ω$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $ω$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $ω$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个完全相对论的模型，用于描述白矮星（WD）与中质量黑洞（IMBH）之间的潮汐响应，并研究了轨道演化和引力波信号。结果显示，潮汐相互作用在IMBH质量超过10^5太阳质量时变得相对论化，并与IMBH自旋敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中质量黑洞（IMBHs）的形成及其质量与自旋的测量是理解大质量黑洞形成的关键。白矮星与IMBH的双星系统能同时发射电磁辐射和引力波，提供了丰富的信息来源。然而，现有的模型无法捕捉其在强引力场下的相对论动力学行为。

Method: 研究开发了一个完全相对论的模型，用于描述白矮星在接近IMBH时的潮汐响应。利用该模型对其潮汐轨道演化和引力波信号进行了分析。

Result: 研究发现，对于质量超过10^5太阳质量的IMBH，潮汐相互作用变得相对论化，并对IMBH的自旋敏感。相对论效应使得潮汐耗散速率的轨道平均相较于牛顿预测降低了约50%。潮汐耗散还会导致轨道偏心率的更快衰减，甚至可能导致近日距随时间增加。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，相对论潮汐耗散对白矮星-IMBH双星系统的多信使信号预测具有动态重要性，并且在观测上是必不可少的。

Abstract: Finding intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and measuring their masses and spins are key to understanding massive black hole formation. White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems.

Several FRB samples can be `retro-fitted' using this to more properly account for survey completeness.

Motivation: 探索磁场在黑洞事件视界附近的积累是否能完全停止吸积，从而实现对黑洞自旋能量的纯粹提取，以及喷流效率是否显著高于吸积能量预算。

Method: 采用先进的一般相对论磁流体动力学（GRMHD）模拟方法，维持了磁化被俘盘状态的准稳态约10,000个动力学时间。

Result: 在磁化被俘盘状态下，喷流功率超过吸积能量输入两个数量级以上，展示了前所未有的高效率和全球性吸积抑制。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了黑洞能量提取的传统限制，并提出了解释强喷流系统的新框架，同时引发了关于这类状态长期稳定性和Blandford-Znajek过程基本限制的重要问题。

Abstract: Relativistic jets from black holes can extract energy not only from accretion but also directly from the black hole's spin, as described by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process.

TL;DR: 论文研究了硒元素在千新星早期的光度和光谱分析中的作用，通过计算原子数据、估算膨胀不透明度并进行光谱分析，探索其对千新星喷射物不透明度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千新星是r过程核合成的重要场所，而轻r过程元素（如硒）对早期喷射物的不透明度有显著影响。因此需要详细研究硒元素的原子数据和光谱特性，以约束其组成。

Method: 使用GRASP2018代码计算了从Se I到Se X的原子数据，并与NIST ASD及其他文献数据进行了对比验证。利用这些数据估算了不同温度和密度下的膨胀不透明度，并通过POSSIS辐射传输代码进行了光谱分析。

Result: 硒的原子数据与NIST ASD结果吻合良好，尤其是高电离态的补充数据。膨胀不透明度的结果与现有文献存在差异。光谱分析表明，仅当喷射物100%为硒时才能观测到其特征，若仅占10%总质量则无法检测。

Conclusion: 硒元素对千新星早期不透明度的贡献取决于其在喷射物中的比例。相关数据已开源至MARTINI平台，可供进一步核合成研究使用。

Abstract: Kilonovae represent key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis, making opacity estimation and spectral analysis crucial for constraining their composition. Since light r-process elements shape the early ($\sim$0.5-1.5$\mathrm{d}$) ejecta opacity, a detailed study of the selenium element with a focus on atomic data calculation, expansion opacity estimation and spectral analysis is presented. Se atomic data are calculated from Se I to Se X using the GRASP2018 code. A systematic analysis and evaluation of their precision is performed through detailed comparison with the NIST ASD, and other works available in the literature. These atomic data are then used to estimate expansion opacity at different temperatures (e.g., T=5000 K, 10000 K, 20000 K, 100000 K) and densities (e.g., $ρ= 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}},\,3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). Spectral analysis has been performed with radiative transfer code POSSIS with a pre-computed opacity grid calculated with new densities and temperatures, ranging from -19.5 to -4.5 $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$ in log-scale and from 1 000 to 51 000 K, respectively. Two scenarios are considered: one in which the opacity contribution comes from 100\% Se ejecta, and another in which Se contributes only partially to the total opacity ($\sim$ 10\% of the total mass). Se atomic calculations show a good agreement with NIST ASD, with accurate energy levels and transitions determined alongside atomic data for higher ionisation stages not fully covered by NIST. The expansion opacities calculated with these new Se data exhibit differences in comparison to existing literature works. Se spectral features can only be observed in the KN scenario consisting of 100\% Se. When Se accounts for about 10\% of the total KN mass, these features become undetectable. All Se results are now available in the new open-source MARTINI platform dedicated to element nucleosynthesis.

Motivation: 探讨长GRB中主发射（ME）和弱延长发射（EE）是否具有相同的物理起源或代表不同的发射机制，以揭示GRB多样性的本质。

Method: 对22个Swift/BAT长GRB进行脉冲分辨分析，独立测量ME和EE的持续时间（T90）、频谱硬度比（HR）、最小可变性时间尺度（MVT）和频谱滞后，并比较两者的性质。

Result: ME和EE在频谱硬度（EE较软）、可变性时间尺度（EE较平滑）和频谱滞后方面存在显著差异，但两者仍符合长GRB的II型坍缩星起源。

Conclusion: EE代表中心引擎的低光度、长时间尺度的物理状态，而非ME的简单延续，可能与黑洞晚期的回吸或原磁星自转减速有关。

Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) frequently exhibit complex prompt emission structures with multiple temporally distinct episodes, such as a main emission (ME) phase followed by a weak extended emission (EE) tail. Whether these subcomponents from a common physical origin with similar classification properties, or instead represent fundamentally different emission mechanisms within a single event, remains an open question. Here, we present a systematic, pulse-resolved analysis of 22 \emph{Swift}/BAT long-duration GRBs, each exhibiting a well-separated, bright ME ($G_1$) followed by a fainter EE ($G_2$) after a background-consistent quiescent gap. For each component, we independently measure standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), spectral hardness ratio (HR), minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag. We then compare these properties between the ME and EE within individual bursts. We find that the EE is systematically softer (lower HR in 19 of 22 events), smoother (longer MVT in 17 of 22 events), and more diverse in spectral lag than the ME. However, both components still occupy the long-GRB track in the traditional duration-hardness and duration-MVT planes, indicating a common Type~II (collapsar) origin. These results suggest that the EE in long GRBs represents a physically distinct regime of the central engine, characterized by a lower luminosity, longer emission timescales, and evolved spectral properties, rather than a simple continuation of the main burst. This picture is consistent with late-time fallback accretion onto a black hole or proto-magnetar spin-down.

Abstract: Nulling is a phenomenon where the emission from a pulsar becomes undetectable (or significantly weaker) for a relatively short period of time, followed by a return to a normal emission state. The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示GCR能量沉积如何通过次级粒子影响平流层化学，特别是臭氧破坏的催化过程。

Method: 模拟了质子、α粒子、CNO和Si核在大气中的传播，考虑了极地和赤道的地磁截止条件，并通过能量沉积计算了离子对生成率及其对NOx和HOx自由基形成的影响。

Result: 研究表明，96%的平流层能量预算来自15-35公里高度的次级粒子，模型预测臭氧减少的分数级在10^-3至10^-2之间，与太阳周期中观测到的背景调制一致。

Conclusion: 研究建立了GCR能量沉积与臭氧化学之间的物理联系，为高能粒子输运与大气光化学模型的耦合提供了基准框架。

Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) energy deposition and its implications for stratospheric chemistry, performed with the Geant4 toolkit. Primary nuclei (protons, $α$, CNO, and Si) were propagated through an atmosphere modeled from 0 to 120~g~cm$^{-2}$, considering both Polar ($R_{\mathrm{c}}=0.1$~GV) and Equatorial ($R_{\mathrm{c}}=15$~GV) geomagnetic cutoff conditions. The simulations resolve the variation of energy deposition with altitude for primary and secondary particles, revealing that $\sim$~96\% of the stratospheric energy budget arises from cascade secondaries within the 15--35~km domain. By converting layer-resolved energy deposition into ion pair production rates, we quantify the resulting formation of odd nitrogen (NO$_{\rm x}$) and odd hydrogen (HO$_{\rm x}$) radicals, which catalyze the destruction of ozone. The modeled production rates peak between 18 and 22~km altitude, leading to an estimated fractional ozone decrease of order $10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$ under average GCR fluxes, consistent with observed background modulation over the solar cycle. These results establish a physically consistent link between cosmic-ray induced energy deposition and ozone chemistry, providing a benchmark framework for coupling high-energy particle transport to atmospheric photochemical models.

Conclusion: 极低光度Iax超新星与较亮样本具有相似内在性质，可纳入子类的速度分布，加强纯爆燃模型的解释力。

Abstract: We present the optical follow-up of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx, two examples from the Iax subclass of thermonuclear supernova (SN) events. With peak absolute magnitudes of $M_\mathrm{V} = -13.7$ and $-14.4$ mag, respectively, both objects belong to the extremely low-luminosity (EL) population of the class. A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass.

TL;DR: Lorentz-covariant spectral universality in Minkowski spacetime is derived, showing temporal and spatial power spectra cannot be related by covariant local mapping in more than one spatial dimension. Temporal index is symmetry-protected and offset from spatial index by a universal factor. Universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion-dominated spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the universal properties of Lorentz-covariant spectral relations in stochastic fields within Minkowski spacetime and identify limitations in spectral inference.

Method: Derived Lorentz-covariant spectral universality by analyzing stationary stochastic fields, focusing on the relationship between temporal and spatial power spectra under Lorentz transformations.

Result: Temporal power spectra index is symmetry-protected and offset from spatial spectra index by a universal geometric factor. Universality fails for anisotropic scaling and dispersion-dominated spectra.

Conclusion: A Lorentz-covariant formulation is essential for accurate relativistic spectral inference, as traditional methods fail under certain conditions.

Abstract: We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime. We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.

Abstract: We present an analytical treatment of Axion-Like-Particle (ALP)--photon mixing with extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation for constant, Gaussian-stochastic, and non-Gaussian magnetic field configurations--with direct implications for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations such as LHAASO, HAWC, and CTA experiments. For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了2021年6月对Mrk 335的XMM-Newton/NuSTAR联合观测数据，结合长期的Swift监测，揭示了中间流量状态下多相遮蔽风的动态变化及其与电离辐射的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Seyfert 1星系中瞬态X射线遮蔽现象的原因，特别是由BLR附近的团块状吸积盘风引起的多相遮蔽风的短期变异性。

Method: 使用XMM-Newton/NuSTAR联合观测数据及Swift长期监测数据，通过宽带光谱能量分布建模确定电离连续谱，并进行自洽的光电离建模。

Result: 发现了三种电离态的光电离吸收体，其性质与2009年中间状态报告的三相遮蔽风一致，显示出十年尺度上的重现性。风的结构在短期（天尺度）内表现出强烈的柱密度和电离度变化。

Conclusion: 多相遮蔽风的结构动态变化支持其在BLR尺度上的存在，且其动力学功率可能在几何和团块性合理假设下达到L_bol的百分之一水平。

Abstract: Transient X-ray obscuration in Seyfert 1 galaxies is thought to arise from clumpy accretion-disk winds near the broad-line region (BLR), but the wind structure and its short-timescale variability are difficult to measure because high-resolution spectra are often suppressed during deep low states. We analyse a coordinated XMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign on Mrk 335 in June 2021, complemented by long-term Swift monitoring, which captured the source in an intermediate-flux state that preserves strong RGS absorption features. We first model the broadband spectral energy distribution to determine the ionising continuum and then perform self-consistent photoionisation modelling of the RGS spectra. The stacked RGS spectrum requires three photoionised absorbers with time-averaged log xi approx 3.63, 3.10, and 2.01 and outflow velocities |v_out| approx 5820, 3210, and 2140 km/s. Their properties are broadly consistent with the three-phase obscurer reported in the 2009 intermediate state, indicating recurring multi-phase obscuration over decade timescales. Using five consecutive RGS observations, we track the wind evolution on day timescales and find strong variability in column density and ionisation in all phases, together with smaller but coherent changes in outflow velocity. During a flare, the low-ionisation phase shows an extreme drop in N_H, and the subsequent epoch exhibits an increase in outflow velocity in all phases, consistent with rapid restructuring and possible radiative acceleration in a clumpy wind. The high-ionisation phase responds most directly to changes in the ionising luminosity, while the lowest-ionisation phase shows at most a delayed response. Order-of-magnitude constraints place the obscurer at BLR scales (approx 10^3-10^5 R_g), and simple continuity arguments suggest kinetic power that can reach the percent level of L_bol for plausible estimates of geometry and clumpiness.

Motivation: GRB 250702B的超长持续时间和独特现象（如X射线耀斑和晚期衰减变化）需要新的模型解释传统坍缩星理论的不足。

Method: 通过模拟中间质量黑洞对白矮星的部分潮汐瓦解及喷流演化，解释了外部前向和反向激波产生的多波段余辉以及内部能量耗散引发的X射线耀斑。

Result: 研究发现部分和完全潮汐瓦解事件可产生GRB 250702B的所有观测特征，确立了中间质量黑洞-白矮星系统为超长伽马暴的新引擎。

Conclusion: 中间质量黑洞潮汐瓦解白矮星事件是超长伽马暴的可行来源，扩展了对伽马暴 progenitor 的认知。

Abstract: The recent detection of GRB 250702B, the longest gamma-ray burst observed to date with prompt emission lasting $\sim 2.5\times 10^4$ seconds, challenges the conventional collapsar model. Its remarkable features--including an extraordinary X-ray flare at $\sim 1.3$ days post-detection, a late-time transition from steep to shallow decay in the X-ray afterglow, and hard spectra extending from keV to MeV energies--point to a novel progenitor. Here we show that these multiwavelength signatures can be consistently explained by a relativistic jet powered by successive partial tidal disruptions of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). By modeling the time-dependent accretion rate from repeated partial disruptions and the resulting jet evolution, we show that the external forward and reverse shocks account for the long-term X-ray, near-infrared, and radio afterglow, whereas the luminous X-ray flare originates from internal energy dissipation caused by collisions between fast and slow relativistic ejecta associated with the final complete disruption. Our findings establish IMBH-WD tidal disruption events as a viable engine for ultra-long GRBs.

TL;DR: 对亮伽马射线耀变体S5 1044+71的多波段数据分析证实了其3年周期的伽马射线信号，并支持其源自超大质量黑洞的进动喷流模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证前人关于伽马射线周期性的发现，并分析多波段数据以探究可能的关联和时间延迟，从而测试喷流进动模型的兼容性。

Method: 利用Fermi-LAT、NuSTAR、Swift等多波段数据，计算单波段谱变异性、相关性及交叉相关性，并用进动喷流模型拟合Fermi-LAT光变曲线。

Result: 确认了伽马射线周期性信号，检测到显著的谱变异性及相关性（低能波段与伽马射线相关性更强），并通过喷流模型成功拟合数据。

Conclusion: 所有多波段观测结果均支持S5 1044+71是由超大质量黑洞驱动的进动相对论性喷流，且伽马射线发射位于宽线区域之外。

Abstract: The bright gamma-ray blazar S5 1044+71 has been identified as showing very significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the Fermi-LAT data in recent studies, with a periodicity of about 3 years. With the completion of a new gamma-ray cycle, we aim to revisit the periodicity in Fermi-LAT data, and analyze all available multi-wavelength (MWL) data to search for possible correlations and time-lags. These observations will be used to test for the compatibility of the observed periodicity with a precessing jet from the supermassive black hole. We analyze data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, AstroSat, ASAS-SN, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and NEOWISE. In addition we present an analysis from historical observations from Palomar and Pulkovo. Single-band spectral variability, MWL correlations, and cross-correlations are computed. We then model the Fermi-LAT light curve with a precessing jet model, providing constraints on the geometry of the system and providing the evolution of the Doppler factor with time. The latter is used as input for MWL fitting of the spectral energy distribution. We confirm previous claims on the existence of a periodic gamma-ray signal. We detect significant spectral variability in gamma-ray, X-rays, and optical/UV data. We detect significant correlation between low-energy (infrared/optical/ultraviolet) data and gamma-rays, with a correlation index of about 1; the correlation between X-rays and gamma-ray is milder, with a correlation index of about 0.3. We do not detect any significant time-lag between bands. The Fermi-LAT light curve is successfully fit by a precessing jet model. The fit to the spectral energy distributions indicate that S5 1044+71 is a typical blazar, in which the gamma-ray emission is located beyond the broad-line region. All MWL observations we present in this work are consistent with the existence of a precessing relativistic jet from the supermassive black hole.

Result: 研究表明，若智能生命普遍存在，技术文明的寿命上限约为5000年。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这些结果是基于费米悖论的上限分析，而非对实际寿命的预测。

Abstract: In this work, we explore constraints on the emergence and longevity of technologically intelligent civilizations in our Galaxy, considering the Fermi paradox. We argue that under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations imposes limits on their lifespan. Our analysis suggests that if intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to $\lesssim 5\times10^3$ years under our most optimistic scenario. Considering electromagnetic communication, we note that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past $\sim 10^5$ years, making the lack of detected signals particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations. We emphasize that these results should be interpreted as upper bounds derived from the Fermi paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.

Conclusion: 这些星团是银河系薄盘化学和动力学演化的可靠示踪体。

Abstract: This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.

Motivation: 高红移宽线AGN的黑洞质量估计存在争议，单时刻维里估计器暗示的极端质量比与观测不符。本文旨在通过结合宽线发射和X射线非探测数据，提供更合理的黑洞质量解释。

Method: 研究者采用自遮蔽的超爱丁顿吸积流框架，结合Kubota & Done（2019）的盘模型和Madau & Haardt（2024）的日冕过冷模型，通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）推断探索参数空间。

Result: 分析结果显示，X射线弱化现象（表现为极端的玻尔兹曼校正、抑制的2-10 keV光度等）自然出现在日冕被狭窄超爱丁顿漏斗约束且辐射过冷的情况下。联合分析支持低质量黑洞以高爱丁顿比吸积的模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，JWST发现的许多高红移宽线AGN可能由快速生长的超爱丁顿黑洞驱动，其日冕辐射抑制和自遮蔽的宽线区几何结构共同导致了对超大质量黑洞的误解。

Abstract: We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \gtrsim 6$.

Result: 测量结果显示，尺寸和Sérsic指数与HST/WFC3数据一致。尺寸质量关系的演化与低红移结果相符。不同质量及类型的星系颜色梯度表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 形态测量数据对大多数星系可靠，为研究高红移星系形态学提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We present measurements of morphological parameters from fitting 53,885 galaxies detected to a magnitude limit of F356W$< 28.5$ in the CEERS NIRCam imaging with galfit in six broadband filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1<z<5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n<2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n>2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout. The structural measurements presented are accurate to $20\%$ or better for most galaxies with F356W $<27.0$ mag and will enable further studies of galaxy morphology to $z\sim10$.

Abstract: Using JWST/MIRI observations, we report the detection of CO$_2$ ice in the dusty torus of the planetary nebula NGC 6302, an environment generally considered hostile to fragile molecular species and ices due to intense UV irradiation. This detection accompanies cold (20-50 K) gas-phase CO$_2$ along the same sightlines. The ice absorption profile exhibits a double-peak profile, a characteristic of pure, crystalline CO$_2$ ice. The CO$_2$ gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments. This discovery demonstrates that the dusty torus provides sufficient shielding to harbour ice chemistry, and that ice-mediated surface reactions must be incorporated into chemical models of planetary nebulae.

Motivation: 分子团的进化分类对理解恒星形成至关重要，但传统方法因模糊特征和距离不确定性常导致未分类。

Method: 结合无监督聚类（HDBSCAN）和有监督学习，利用MALT90和Spitzer数据，基于少量分子线特征进行分类。

Result: 识别出稳定的原生恒星团和非活跃区域，并为522个不确定对象提供分类。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效揭示天体化学数据中的进化结构，是对传统方法的有力补充。

Abstract: The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods.

TL;DR: 3D-Herschel结合Herschel远红外数据与CANDELS/3D-HST数据，通过贝叶斯推断框架Prospector-β对41,387个星系建模，发现远红外数据对星系的恒星和尘埃特性测量至关重要，但需注意MIR-to-IR转换与恒星质量的关系。

Motivation: 旨在结合远红外数据提升对尘埃遮蔽宇宙的理解，并通过多波段数据更精确测量星系的恒星和尘埃性质。

Method: 使用Prospector-β贝叶斯推断框架，结合0.3-350μm的光度数据对41,387个星系进行建模，比较有无远红外约束的拟合结果。

Result: 远红外数据显著改善尘埃温度测量（提高∼7K），且MIR-to-IR转换与恒星质量相关。Herschel对高红移低质量星系仅能提供上限限制。

Conclusion: 远红外数据对精确测量星系尘埃特性至关重要，但需要新一代远红外望远镜以解决高红移星系的测量限制。

Abstract: We present 3D-Herschel, a new 0.3-350$μ$m photometric catalog that combines deblended Herschel far-infrared (FIR) imaging with the CANDELS/3D-HST legacy fields to probe the dust-obscured universe. Using the 17-parameter fitting code Prospector-$β$, a Bayesian inference framework, we model 41,387 galaxies spanning 0.5 $< z <$ 2.5 to measure stellar and dust properties with realistic error bars. Comparing fits with and without FIR constraints, we find that for the 3.2$\%$ of galaxies with $>3 σ$ detections in at least two Herschel bands, UV-MIR-only models (0.3-24$μ$m) recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and stellar masses (50-70$\%$ within the median 1$σ$ error). Consequently, the star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset, with an average deviation of 0.1$\pm$0.07 dex at fixed stellar mass for FIR-detected sources at all redshifts. However, the use of rigid log-average IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters ($γ$, $U_{\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\mathrm{PAH}}$) in UV-MIR modeling corresponds to an unevolving MIR-to-IR luminosity ratio and cold dust temperatures. By contrast, fits that include Herschel photometry, with added freedom in the FIR, yield dust temperatures that are $\sim$7K warmer at all redshifts, with $\sim$0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7$μ$m luminosity ratios at the low-mass end of a Herschel-detected sample (log($M_{\star}$) $\sim$9.6 $M_{\odot}$). These results demonstrate that MIR-to-IR conversions depend on stellar mass, cautioning against $L_{\mathrm{IR}}$-independent templates without FIR data. For galaxies with $<10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z>1.5$, even with state-of-the-art analysis, Herschel can at best provide upper limits due to source confusion; next-generation FIR telescopes will be essential to fully characterize dust emission in distant galaxies.

TL;DR: ViT-MDNz是一种深度学习模型，用于从单波段星系图像直接估计红移及其不确定性，结合Vision Transformer提取形态特征和Mixture Density Network预测概率密度函数。在DESI-LS数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在只有单波段图像可用的情况下红移估计的挑战，为未来大规模巡天（如DESI和LSST）提供更完整的红移目录。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer (ViT)提取深度形态特征，并通过Mixture Density Network (MDN)预测红移概率密度函数。模型在DESI-LS的30万张单波段图像上训练和评估。

Result: 在r波段红移z≲1范围内，模型达到σ_NMAD=0.034和f_out=2.6%。概率积分变换(PIT)和连续排名概率评分(CRPS)验证了预测概率密度函数的校准性和准确性。

Conclusion: ViT-MDNz证明了仅靠形态特征即可实现竞争性红移估计，且结合颜色信息可进一步优化。该模型为有限波段覆盖的星系样本提供了一种实用红移估计方法。

Abstract: To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\rm out} = 2.6\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.

TL;DR: 研究测试了“小红点”（LRDs）是否是由吸积驱动的尘埃红化的高倾斜对应物，并通过建模验证了其与“小蓝点”（LBDs）的联系。模型表明，倾斜依赖的SEDs可以解释JWST观测到的极端宽Hα等效宽度，而无需完全包围的气体“茧”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LRDs是否为LBDs的高倾斜、尘埃红化版本，从而通过取向统一两者的观测特性。

Method: 采用几何厚的、辐射压力支持的吸积流模型，结合Cloudy模拟倾斜依赖的SEDs，分析LRDs的光谱特性。

Result: 模型成功复现了JWST观测到的极端Hα等效宽度，支持LRDs与LBDs的取向统一理论，并提出了相关的光谱趋势预测。

Conclusion: 通过取向依赖的模型，LRDs和LBDs的观测特性得到了统一，预测了Hα等效宽度、Balmer下降、高电离线强度等的相关性。

Abstract: We test whether "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs ("Little Blue Dots", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.

Motivation: 研究卫星矮星系在不同环境和宇宙时间中的分布和演化，以便更好地理解星系形成和演化的机理，尤其是宿主星系性质和大尺度环境的影响。

Method: 结合Millennium模拟和半解析模型，构建宿主星系及其卫星的样本，分析卫星丰度和径向分布在星系团、星系群和空洞环境中的差异，并追踪从z=2到z=0的演化。

Result: 卫星丰度与宿主质量和环境密切相关，密集环境中的卫星丰度较低，径向分布逐渐扁平化。空洞环境中卫星分布更集中，且随时间演化趋势不同。

Conclusion: 卫星星系的数量和分布主要受环境影响，宿主质量次之。未来的广域巡天将为这些预测提供严格检验。

Abstract: Context:Satellite dwarf galaxies provide key constraints on galaxy formation and evolution as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host properties and large-scale environment.
  Aims:This study quantifies the dependence of satellite populations on host stellar mass, morphology and star formation activity across diverse environments and traces their evolution with cosmic time within the LCDM framework.
  Methods:The Millennium simulation combined with the semi-analytic model is employed to construct consistent samples of host galaxies brighter than Mr < -16 and their satellites (M_* >= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr < -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group and void environments and their evolution is traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins.
  Results:Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0 radial profiles reveal strong central concentrations in voids flattened distributions in clusters and intermediate trends in groups. Their redshift evolution shows progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments stability for massive hosts and increasing central concentration in voids. The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance further highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups and strong late-time suppression in clusters.
  Conclusions:The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.

Motivation: 研究目的是通过Cepheid变星的光周期-光度关系，精确测量两个典型活动星系核（AGN）NGC 4303和NGC 1068的距离。

Method: 使用哈勃太空望远镜的F555W和F814W滤光片进行非冗余时间间隔观测，识别Cepheid候选体；基于Riess等人对LMC的几何距离校准周期-光度关系，并修正金属丰度影响。

Conclusion: 成功测定了两个AGN的距离，为后续研究提供了重要的距离基准。

Abstract: We present Cepheid-based distances to two canonical AGN: NGC 4303 (M 61) and NGC 1068. Data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope with nonredundant time spacing over 12 visits for each target, and observations were made with the F555W and F814W filters. We found 32,694 point sources in NGC 4303, and 130 of these were determined to be strong Cepheid candidates with periods ranging ~$13-93$ days. In NGC 1068, we found 20,207 point sources, where 51 of these were strong Cepheid candidates with periods ~$14-92$ days. We fit the period$-$luminosity relationship, calibrated based on a geometric distance to the LMC by Riess et al. (2019), to our Cepheid candidates in each galaxy and correct for potential effects of metallicity. Using a distance constraint for the LMC given by Pietrzyński et al. (2019), this yields a distance modulus of $μ= 31.083 \pm 0.035$ mag for NGC 4303 and $μ= 30.150 \pm 0.106$ mag for NGC 1068. Thus, we measure distances of $D = 16.47 \pm 0.27$ Mpc to NGC 4303 and $D = 10.72 \pm 0.52$ Mpc to NGC 1068.

Abstract: This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.

Conclusion: 该框架为局部反馈和全局势能与宏观星系演化的联系提供了最小化且可解释的模型，同时表明暗物质晕散射会抑制平均恒星形成率但增强间歇性。

Abstract: We present a computational framework for galactic evolution based on a coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator, implemented with the \textbf{Stochastic Hopf Engine}. Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \textbf{Euler--Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold.
  Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \textbf{Fokker--Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure.
  Including differential shear $Ω(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} < 0$) yields ``Red and Dead'' cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.

TL;DR: 通过VLBI检测到四个螺旋星系宿主中的双瓣射电强AGN（螺旋DRAGNs）的致密射电核，揭示了其弱相对论性喷流和低频射电爱丁顿比，表明其喷流活动可能存在间歇性或长期循环。

Motivation: 研究旨在理解螺旋星系宿主中罕见双瓣射电强AGN的特性，挑战传统认为强喷流仅与椭圆星系宿主的关联。

Method: 利用公开VLBI数据档案，识别了四个源中的致密核，并在其中两个中分辨了秒差距级喷流。分析了喷流亮度温度、喷流对向喷流比及射电爱丁顿比。

Result: 核心亮度温度低（约10^9 K），喷流速度仅轻度相对论性（β≲0.6）。射电爱丁顿比低（-5到-8），表明喷流功率弱。部分源位于黑洞活动基本平面上，表明其吸积-喷流耦合机制与其他AGN相似。

Conclusion: 螺旋DRAGNs的VLBI尺度核心可能反映喷流启动的早期或间歇磁化阶段，其弱喷流与大规模喷流瓣共存暗示喷流活动为周期性或长期持续。

Abstract: We report milliarcsecond-scale VLBI detections of compact radio nuclei in four spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical hosts. Using public VLBI data archives, we identify compact cores in four sources and resolve parsec-scale jets in two of them. The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($β\lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $θ\lesssim 80^\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.

Abstract: Young star-forming clumps (SFCs) emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV), making UV imaging ideal for detecting them. The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations.

### [58] [Group Pre-processing in J1611+4026: Minor Rejuvenation of a Massive ETG fueled by Interaction-driven Gas Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22904)
*Yaosong Yu,Qihang Chen,Zizhao He,Limeng Deng,Liang Jing,Jianhui Lian*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 该论文研究了星系群J1611+4026中的三重系统，发现两个气体丰富的伴星系（A和B）的合并激发了主星系（C）的低水平恒星形成活动，揭示了卫星星系相互作用通过气体转移驱动宿主星系演化的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星系群内部的相互作用是星系演化的关键驱动力，但目前直接在观测上将卫星星系的动力学过程与宿主星系的重启活动联系起来仍具挑战性。本研究旨在利用多波段数据揭示这一过程的定量证据。

Method: 采用DESI-LS的光学成像数据、DESI和P200的光谱数据，结合2D形态分解工具GALIGHT以及恒星人口合成模型BAGPIPES和CIGALE，分析了成员星系的结构特性和恒星形成历史。

Result: 发现伴星系A延伸出约15.15 kpc的非对称潮汐尾，证实了它们之间的相互作用。尽管主星系C在形态和光谱上看似静止，但检测到轻微的重启信号（内部尘埃消光E(B-V)~0.53和紫外超）。恒星形成历史重建表明近期（约100 Myr）的星暴贡献极小(f_burst < 0.1%)，推测这种活动由伴星系剥离的金属富集气体触发。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持星系群预处理理论，即卫星星系间的相互作用通过气体转移驱动宿主星系的低水平恒星形成，为密集环境中相互作用驱动的演化提供了定量基准。

Abstract: Interactions within galaxy groups are fundamental drivers of galactic evolution, and establishing a direct observational link between the dynamical processes of satellite galaxies and the rejuvenation of massive host galaxies remains challenging. We present a multi-wavelength work of J1611+4026, a unique triple system characterised by a massive early-type host galaxy, Component C and two gas-rich companions, Components A and B, which are currently undergoing a major merger in its near environment. Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \textsc{BAGPIPES} and \textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of ``minor rejuvenation'', characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\rm burst} < 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions. These results strongly suggest group pre-processing, where interactions between satellite galaxies drive low-level star formation in the massive host through gas transfer, providing a quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.

Motivation: 探讨自洽引力场构建的星系模型中分布函数(DFs)的物理性，以及如何满足特定条件以避免不物理的速度分布。

Method: 通过分析分布函数(DFs)作为作用积分J的解析函数，构建各向同性与径向偏置球系统的DFs，研究其在自洽势下的行为。

Result: 发现DFs在J_φ->0时需要满足特定条件，否则速度分布不物理；径向偏置球系统对四极摄动不稳定。

Conclusion: 混沌可能是维持约束的关键因素，特别是在绝热盘生长过程中；自洽模型的构建揭示了径向偏置系统的不稳定性。

Abstract: Galaxy models comprising several components (including dark matter) that are bound by the self-consistently generated gravitational field are readily constructed from distribution functions (DFs) that are analytic functions of the action integrals J. We explain why such models have unphysical velocity distributions unless the DFs of hot components satisfy certain conditions as J_φ-> 0. We show how DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems can be constructed with specified f(J). We show how to construct DFs for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations. Chaos is likely key to maintenance of these constraints during adiabatic disc growth.

TL;DR: 论文通过JWST NIRSpec光谱研究了高发射线星系（EELGs），分析了其AGN或年轻恒星的形成，并发现AGN在某些高EW源中比例显著但不主导发射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在测试光度选择的效能，并揭示早期宇宙中产生过量电离辐射的源类型（AGN或年轻恒星形成）。

Method: 利用JWST NIRSpec光谱（来自CAPERS、RUBIES、THRILS和CEERS调查）对光选EELGs进行分析，通过Hα宽发射线识别AGN，并比较光学线比率和形态学。

Result: 发现10%的光选EELGs存在宽巴耳末线，深光谱中增至35%；AGN在一些高EW源中比例显著，但窄Hα成分在高EW源中占主导。

Conclusion: 即使存在AGN，它通常不主导极端发射线，表明光度选择的EELGs中AGN比例较高但发射主要由其他机制驱动。

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic study of photometrically identified extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) >5000 A of either H alpha or H beta + [OIII] in the CEERS legacy deep field utilizing JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS and CEERS surveys. This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STILTS作为一个强大的天文数据分析工具，其复杂的语法对新手用户构成了较高的学习门槛。为解决这一问题，开发了STILTS-NLI。

Method: 通过在一个合成生成的数据集上微调一个紧凑的开源大型语言模型（LLM），开发了STILTS-NLI。数据集经过精心策划和验证，确保了功能覆盖全面且命令语法正确。

Result: 实验表明，该专用模型生成的命令有效，并且在某些情况下性能优于更大的专有模型。

Conclusion: STILTS-NLI提供了一种低资源、易访问的解决方案，显著降低了使用STILTS的门槛。

Abstract: The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set (STILTS) is a powerful suite for astronomical data analysis, particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. However, like other software suites in astronomy its comprehensive syntax creates a significant learning curve to new users. To address this, we present STILTS-NLI, a natural language interface that generates STILTS commands from user prompts, with agentic support for a user-friendly experience. We developed STILTS-NLI by fine-tuning a compact, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset was curated and validated to ensure both comprehensive coverage of key STILTS functionalities and the syntactic correctness of the resulting commands. Our results demonstrate that this specialised model generates valid commands that match and in some cases outperform larger proprietary models. By leveraging small, open-source models, STILTS-NLI provides an accessible, low-resource solution that lowers the barrier to entry for using STILTS.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Zernike多项式的自校准方法，用于精确建模宽视场成像中的几何畸变，应用于WFST望远镜数据，成功将系统不确定性控制在10毫角秒以内，并将WFST的位置校准到Gaia DR3坐标系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宽视场成像中几何畸变的精确建模对天文测量的准确性至关重要。

Method: 使用Zernike多项式构建全局几何畸变模型，通过比较WFST r波段恒星位置与Gaia DR3数据的偏移量进行分析。

Result: 方法在单次曝光中的系统不确定性中位值低于10毫角秒；WFST的全局畸变主要由光学设计中的彗差主导，而快速变化可能与大气色散校正器有关；82次曝光的相对位置稳定性良好（平移标准差小于0.1像素，旋转标准差小于1.8角秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将WFST的天文测量系统与Gaia DR3坐标系关联，未来将进一步优化。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of geometric distortion is essential for precise astrometric calibration in wide-field imaging surveys. We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.

Motivation: 现代天文学的主要目标之一是表征类地系外行星的大气成分，这在可见光和红外波段需要极高灵敏度的探测器。传统半导体探测器在中红外难以满足低暗计数率和高灵敏度的需求。

Conclusion: 研究展示了中红外探测器技术的潜力，并提出通过优化设计和测量设置可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $μ$m and measure resolving powers ($E/δE$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $μ$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.

Motivation: 推动小内工作角日冕仪的技术发展，为未来极大望远镜观测温带系外行星的高对比度成像提供支持。

Method: 设计并制造了针对窄带875nm和宽带z'滤波器优化的相位偏移焦平面掩模，通过内部光源和MagAOX天文台进行了地面和天空测试。

Result: 在875nm和z'波段分别实现了约0.74λ/D和0.76λ/D的小内工作角，内部光源下的平均原始对比度分别为1.6e-3和1.3e-3，天空测试的平均原始对比度分别为1.4e-2和7.8e-3。

Conclusion: 未来将通过改进焦平面掩模的设计与制造工艺以及集成焦平面波前控制技术，进一步提升性能并实现更深对比度。

Abstract: Advancing the technological development of small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs is essential to enabling high-contrast imaging of temperate exoplanets with future extremely large telescopes. The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'. These are mainly limited by the focal plane mask manufacturing errors, jitter, and residual quasi-static speckles in MagAO-X. We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.

Result: 将GHASH计算转化为对数时间过程，提升吞吐量，适用于PB级天文图像数据的安全处理。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据提供者提供了兼顾安全性和高效性的解决方案，支持数据平稳过渡到FAIR公共存档。

Abstract: The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.
  The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.
  Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.

Motivation: 通过观测类星体吸收线系统，验证标准宇宙学模型中的CMB温度与红移的关系。

Method: 利用HCN、HCO+、HNC及其同位素的吸收谱线，通过蒙特卡洛采样和柱密度分布假设矫正误差，计算激发温度并排除HCO+的干扰。

Result: 从HCN和HNC的平均激发温度得到z=0.68时CMB温度为4.50±0.17 K，与标准宇宙学模型高度一致。

Conclusion: 研究首次在z=0.68时精确测定了CMB温度，证实了标准宇宙学模型的预测。

Abstract: We analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar B0218+357 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and obtained absorption spectra of the $J$=2-1 and $J$=3-2 rotational transitions of HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, H$^{13}$CN, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ at the cosmological redshift of $z\!=\!0.68$. For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\pm0.17\,\mathrm{K}}$. This constitutes the first measurement of the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ based on a quasar absorption line system and represents the most precise determination at this redshift, highly consistent with the standard Big Bang cosmological model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于超大质量黑洞（SLABs）的存在及其可观测后果直到最近才被认真考虑，因此对其丰度的限制较少。

Method: 利用SLABs在宇宙微波背景中产生的巨大阴影，将其视为微波数据中的负源进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，质量为$≻10^{17}\,M_{\odot}$的SLABs在最后散射面内被排除，并对质量$10^{15}$--$10^{18}\,M_{\odot}$的黑洞给出了密度上限$\Omega_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-5}$。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了对SLABs存在的强有力限制，并讨论了吸积效应对这些限制的影响。

Abstract: Stupendously large astrophysical black holes (SLABs) are hypothetical black holes with masses of more than a trillion Suns. Because observable consequences of their existence have only recently been seriously considered, there have been relatively few constraints on their abundance. This work motivates a simple yet powerful constraint on SLABs: their huge shadows are visible against the cosmic microwave background. SLABs could thus appear as negative sources in microwave data. In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\gtrsim 10^{17}\ M_{\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $Ω_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\ M_{\odot}$. I also discuss the effects of accretion and their implications for the limits: SLAB growth, positive accretion luminosity, and obscuring material.

Abstract: The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years. In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\sim 12300\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP.

Result: 接触相互作用改变了稳态解的密度分布，影响了引力坍缩的特征阶段（如壳交叉事件），但弛豫过程未收敛到最低能稳态解。

Conclusion: 局部自相互作用对FDM的非线性动力学有重要影响，需在高维和更现实的宇宙学环境中进一步研究。

Abstract: We investigate the role of contact interactions in the dynamics of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) modeled through the Schrödinger-Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. While the $Λ$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的相互作用暗能量（IDE）模型，以研究哈勃常数（$H_0$）的红移演化，旨在缓解哈勃张力。该模型通过暗能量与暗物质之间的能量交换，引入了$H_0$的红移依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哈勃张力问题（即不同测量方法得到的$H_0$值不一致）亟待解决。作者希望通过IDE模型提供一种理论一致且观测可行的机制，描述$H_0$的红移演化。

Method: 作者对IDE模型进行了改进，并利用包括DESI DR2和SDSS的重子声学振荡（BAO）、宇宙计时器、Pantheon样本的Ia型超新星以及Planck CMB距离先验在内的多组观测数据进行了分析。

Result: 晚期宇宙数据的分析显示$H_0$随红移呈现下降趋势，支持幂律演化（$α\sim10^{-2}$）。加入CMB数据后，约束进一步收紧（$α\sim10^{-5}$），表明高红移下暗区相互作用受抑制。

Conclusion: IDE框架为描述$H_0$的红移演化提供了理论一致性和观测可行性，有望缓解哈勃张力。

Abstract: We develop a modified interacting dark energy (IDE) model to study the redshift evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), in light of the Hubble tension. In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension.

Abstract: Voids are parts of the cosmic web least affected by non-linearities and baryonic feedback. We thus calculate the sensitivity of voids to the nature of dark matter (DM), using ultra-light axions as a concrete model and the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and \textit{Euclid} galaxy surveys as observational settings. We simulate axion effects on voids using mass-peak patch simulations and find that: (i) axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos leading to the merging of smaller (radius $< 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids into fewer larger (radius $> 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids; and (ii) voids in the presence of axions are emptier of halos, thereby suppressing the void-halo correlation function. These effects strengthen as axion particle mass $m_\mathrm{a}$ decreases. We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $Λ$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$) to $< 4.6\%$ of the DM (at $95\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits. Conversely, we show that a Universe with a dark sector consisting of axions at the $10\%$ level, as motivated by the string axiverse, can be recovered with $\sim 2 σ$ preference. A DESI-like survey achieves comparable results. Axion and $Λ$CDM parameters have different degeneracies given VSF and galaxy power spectrum data, indicating future combined analyses will be most powerful in disentangling the DM nature. We anticipate our results will extend to other (e.g., warm or interacting) DM models.

Result: 发现大于$~10\,\hMpc$尺度上速度统计可靠，但小尺度因星系属性与环境相关性出现显著偏差，扩展关系参数可减轻这些偏差。

Abstract: The Tully-Fisher (TF) and Fundamental Plane (FP) relations are widely used to infer extragalactic distances and peculiar velocities, enabling measurements of large-scale velocity statistics and cosmological parameters. Using the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation, we assess the accuracy of these methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\sim10\,\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses.

Abstract: Enhanced inverse Compton (IC) losses at high redshift steepen diffuse radio spectra in galaxy clusters, making low-frequency (~100 MHz) observations favorable. However, low-frequency studies often lack the resolution needed to locate particle acceleration sites or separate diffuse emission from radio galaxies. In this paper, we unveil the properties of the radio relic in the distant cluster PSZ2G091.83+26.11 (z=0.822) by resolving the acceleration site and inspecting the downstream region. Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5'' maps. High-resolution 0.4'' and 1.9'' images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9'' profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution.

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.
