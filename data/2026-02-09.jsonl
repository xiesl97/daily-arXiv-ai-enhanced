For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way."}

The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical ``lifetime problem\" of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\\,M_\\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\\log_{10}(L_{\\rm k}/L_\\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass.

Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem.

The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations."}

If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift -- when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important -- the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years."}

In addition, accurate BH masses have been determined by spatially resolving the broad-line region with GRAVITY for a handful of AGNs. Here, we present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images using surface-brightness profile fitting with state-of-the-art programs. We derive AGN luminosity and host-galaxy properties, such as radii and luminosities for spheroid, disk, and bar (if present). The spheroid effective radii were used to measure stellar velocity dispersion from integral-field spectroscopy. Since the BH masses of our sample do not depend on any assumption of the virial factor needed in single-epoch spectroscopic mass estimates, we can show that the resulting scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive BHs and their host galaxies match those of quiescent galaxies, naturally extending to lower masses in these (predominantly) spiral galaxies. We find that the inner AGN orientation, as traced by the broad-line region inclination angle, is uncorrelated with the host-galaxy disk.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence."}

It is an X-ray source and a variable nonthermal radio source. It forms, together with the late-type T Tauri star KPNO 15, a pair of oppositely directed walkaway stars launched when a multiple system broke apart ~5600 yr ago. Momentum conservation indicates a mass of G2 of only ~0.7 Msun, much lower than the ~1.9 Msun determined from evolutionary models. G2 is virtually a twin of FK Com, the prototype of a class of evolved stars resulting from coalescence of W UMa binaries. We suggest that G2 became a very close and highly eccentric binary during viscous evolution in the protostellar stage and with KPNO 15 formed a triple system, which again was part of a larger unstable group including the binary G3 and the single G1. Dynamical evolution led to multiple bound ejections of KPNO 15 before it finally escaped after ~2 Myr. As a result the G2 binary recoiled and contracted 5600 yr ago, became Darwin unstable and merged in a major outburst ~2000 yr ago. The nearby compact triple system G1+G3 was also disturbed, and broke up 4900 yr ago, forming another walkaway pair. The G5 star HD 283572 has similar unusual properties, indicating that G2 is not a pathological case. G2 is now fading towards a new stable configuration. YSO mergers may be rather common and could explain some FUor eruptions."}

We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $Λ$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\\rm s}$ and $t_{\\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\\simeq0.055$ and $z\\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\\rm s}$ and $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role."}

Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies."}

The nucleus of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak exhibited particularly dramatic rotational changes when near perihelion in 2017 April. Here, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations from 2017 December to study the post-perihelion lightcurve of the nucleus and to assess the nucleus size. From both Hubble photometry and non-gravitational acceleration measurements we find a diminutive nucleus with effective radius r = 500+/-100 m. Systematic optical variations are consistent with a two-peaked (i.e., rotationally symmetric) lightcurve with period 0.60+/-0.01 days, substantially different from periods measured earlier in 2017. The spin of the nucleus likely reversed between perihelion in 2017 April and December as a result of the strong outgassing torque. We infer a dimensionless moment arm k = 0.013, about twice the median value in short-period comets. The lightcurve range of 0.4 magnitudes indicates a projected nucleus axis ratio greater than 1.4:1, while the active fraction of the nucleus decreased from 2.4 in 2001 (suggesting augmentation of the gas production by sublimating coma ice grains) to 0.14 in 2017, a result of long-term modification of the surface. We find that the physical lifetime of this small nucleus to spin-up is short compared to the reported 1500 year dynamical time spent in the current orbit. Two limiting reconciliations of this inequality are suggested. The nucleus could be in a state of unusually strong activity, leading us to over-estimate the average mass loss rate and outgassing torque and so to under-estimate the physical lifetime. Alternatively, the nucleus could be the surviving remnant of a once larger body for which outgassing torques were less effective in changing the spin."}

While nearby flux emergence is often linked to their destabilisation, the specific characteristics of both the emerging flux and the filament that determine whether an eruption occurs remain unclear. We report observations of a quiescent filament that did not erupt following the nearby emergence of active region NOAA 13270 and a subsequent C-class flare in April 2023. Our analysis combines multi-viewpoint extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and X-ray imaging with EUV spectroscopy, radio imaging and measurements of, and extrapolations from, the photospheric magnetic field. We identify the formation of a coronal null point and fan-spine topology at the interface between the active region and filament which exhibited persistent slow reconnection, indicated by chromospheric brightenings, persistent radio emission, and plasma upflows. Our results indicate that ongoing reconnection and jets can relieve magnetic stress and enable filament stability, even when under strong perturbation. We suggest that the orientation of emerging flux relative to the ambient field is a critical parameter in filament evolution, and provide observational constraints for models of filament stability and eruption."}

The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $Λ$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases. In terms of performance, DZS runs in our test simulations can save up to $\\sim$ 50% runtime compared to the non-DZS counterparts. A scaling to larger simulated volumes suggests that performance gains could improve by an additional $\\sim$ 20% at the resolution levels of current state-of-the-art simulations.

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Some cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in powering the Ly$α$ nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars. In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$α$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$α$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line. We detect powerful outflows in all the quasars of our sample, with velocities $>1500~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and kinetic energies $ \\gtrsim 2\\times10^{43}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $>2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole. When excluding one outlier, we find a positive monotonic correlation between the outflow power and the Ly$α$ nebulae size ($ρ=0.89$, $p=0.03$) and luminosity ($ρ=0.6$, $p=0.28$). Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$α$ nebula. Our results provide tentative evidence in support of the theoretical prediction that AGN-driven outflows at ISM scales open a low-optical-depth path for central Ly$α$ photons to reach the CGM and create extended nebulae."}

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence."}

With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \\pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin.

The observed abundances are the result of the balance between the accretion flux and the dilution of this planetary material by internal transport processes. A recent study showed that more massive DA WDs are less polluted than smaller mass ones. It was suggested that the reason could be related to the formation of planetary systems when these stars were on the main sequence. The aim of this work is to test how internal dilution processes, including thermohaline convection, change with WD masses, and whether such an effect could account for variations in the observed pollution. We computed the efficiency of atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection after the accretion of heavy elements onto WDs using static DA models with various masses, effective temperatures, and hydrogen contents. We confirm that thermohaline convection is always more efficient in diluting accreted elements than atomic diffusion, as previously shown in the literature. However, we find that element dilution by thermohaline convection is less efficient in massive WDs than in smaller mass ones, due to their larger internal density. We showed that the differences in observed heavy element pollution in WDs according to their masses cannot be explained by the dilution induced by atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing alone. Indeed, the pollution by planetary system accretion should be more easily detectable in massive WDs than in low-mass ones. We discuss other processes that should be taken into account before drawing any conclusion about the occurrences of planetary systems according to the mass of the star on the main sequence."}

Adopting a few simple phenomenological models, we quantitatively demonstrate that a satisfactory fit with a model with late-time expansion history can only be achieved if one of the following is true: 1) there is a sharp step in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae at very low redshift, $z\\sim 0.01$, or 2) the distance duality relation, $d_L(z)=(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, is broken. Both solutions are trivial in that they effectively decouple the calibrated SNIa measurements from other data, and this qualitatively agrees with previous work built on studying specific dark-energy models. We also identify a less effective class of late-time solutions with a transition at $z\\simeq 0.15$ that lead to a more modest improvement in fit to the data than models with a very low-z transition. Our conclusions are largely unchanged when we include surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements, with their current systematic uncertainties, to our analysis.

Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ wave signal.

This study leverages data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, in conjunction with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic constraints from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, to infer parameters for over 17,000 RGs. We use the code PARAM to homogeneously infer stellar properties considering in detail the sensitivity of our results to different choices of observational constraints. We focus on age estimation, identifying potentially unreliable age determinations, and highlight stars with unreliable $Δν$ measurements based on comparisons using Gaia luminosities. These are particularly relevant in K2 data due to the short duration of the observations of each campaign, and therefore important to characterise for Galactic archaeology studies where the spatial range of K2 is a benefit. Thanks to the combination of data from different missions we explore trends in age, mass, and orbital parameters such as $R_\\mathrm{g}$ and $Z_\\mathrm{max}$, and examine time-resolved [$α$/M]-[Fe/H] planes across different Galactic regions. Additionally, we compare age distributions in low- and high-$α$ populations and chemically selected ex situ stars. The study also extends known mass-[C/N] ratio relationships to lower masses. The catalogues resulting from this work will be instrumental in addressing key questions in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution, and to improve training sets for machine-learning-based age estimations."}

After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\\sim{\\rm few}\\times10^{15}\\,{\\rm eV}$ to $\\sim{\\rm few}\\times10^{17}\\,{\\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee.

Linear study of shear-driven instabilities", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper is the first in a series investigating magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that may contribute to angular-momentum transport and magnetic-field evolution in stellar radiative zones. We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport."}

It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $κ\\in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $ξ\\sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars."}

The observed abundances are the result of the balance between the accretion flux and the dilution of this planetary material by internal transport processes. A recent study showed that more massive DA WDs are less polluted than smaller mass ones. It was suggested that the reason could be related to the formation of planetary systems when these stars were on the main sequence. The aim of this work is to test how internal dilution processes, including thermohaline convection, change with WD masses, and whether such an effect could account for variations in the observed pollution. We computed the efficiency of atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection after the accretion of heavy elements onto WDs using static DA models with various masses, effective temperatures, and hydrogen contents. We confirm that thermohaline convection is always more efficient in diluting accreted elements than atomic diffusion, as previously shown in the literature. However, we find that element dilution by thermohaline convection is less efficient in massive WDs than in smaller mass ones, due to their larger internal density. We showed that the differences in observed heavy element pollution in WDs according to their masses cannot be explained by the dilution induced by atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing alone. Indeed, the pollution by planetary system accretion should be more easily detectable in massive WDs than in low-mass ones. We discuss other processes that should be taken into account before drawing any conclusion about the occurrences of planetary systems according to the mass of the star on the main sequence."}

The system is triggered by new entries in the CCMC DONKI database and first applies the drag-based ELEvo model to determine whether an Earth impact is expected and estimate arrival time. This estimate defines a temporal window constraining the search for CME signatures in real-time L1 in situ solar wind data, where the magnetic obstacle (MO) is automatically detected using the deep learning model ARCANE. Upon MO onset, iterative reconstructions with the semi-empirical flux rope model 3DCORE are performed, using a Monte Carlo fitting scheme, producing continuously updated forecasts of the remaining magnetic field profile.\n  We evaluate the pipeline using 3870 archived DONKI entries and archived NOAA real-time in situ data from 2013-2025, assessing forecast performance at different stages of MO observation. For 61 events with an associated ground-truth counterpart in the ICMECAT catalog, forecasts based on initial MO data already achieve performance comparable to full-event reconstructions. Typical errors are ~5 hours in timing of magnetic field extrema and ~10 nT in field strength metrics, with limited systematic improvement as more of the event is observed. Results show substantial event variability and systematic underestimation of extrema, indicating deviations from ideal flux rope assumptions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fully autonomous real-time forecasting while highlighting limitations imposed by event complexity and model representational capacity."}

We report detections of splashback radii in total light stacks, i.e. image stacks centered on the cores of galaxy clusters. Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions."}

Despite their diverse physical origins -- such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity -- SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations."}

For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \\texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \\texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \\textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition.

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}

Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory."}

A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies", "comment": "20 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum.

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

Using $>350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components -- corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) -- plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\\sim800$ km/s and $\\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions.

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}

Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV.

We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates."}

Thanks to the combination of data from different missions we explore trends in age, mass, and orbital parameters such as $R_\\mathrm{g}$ and $Z_\\mathrm{max}$, and examine time-resolved [$α$/M]-[Fe/H] planes across different Galactic regions. Additionally, we compare age distributions in low- and high-$α$ populations and chemically selected ex situ stars. The study also extends known mass-[C/N] ratio relationships to lower masses. The catalogues resulting from this work will be instrumental in addressing key questions in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution, and to improve training sets for machine-learning-based age estimations."}

Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 10 pages (+5 pages of Appendix), 13 figures", "summary": "The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $γ$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{BLR}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \\pm 0.19$, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{disk}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \\pm 0.19$ and $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{torus}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \\pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\\log(M_{BH}/M_{\\odot})=8.36 \\pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $λ=L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \\pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature."}

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}
