This first-epoch survey will reach $\\mathrm{H}\\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$σ$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \\textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science.

For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\\simeq 80\\,μ$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\\pm 1.0\\,μ$as over $\\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\\simeq 10\\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments."}

The radio sky below 30 MHz is largely unexplored and is thought to contain spectral signatures of new physics in the early, high-redshift Universe. Achieving precision measurements in this band requires accurate understanding of antenna performance and systematics. For upcoming lunar surface radio astronomy missions, this modeling will be challenging because antennas will deploy at heights that are only a small fraction of a wavelength above the lunar regolith, where strong coupling between the antenna and the surface can significantly alter impedance, radiation patterns, and efficiency. The challenge is compounded by the layered dielectric structure of the regolith and the tendency for permittivity to increase with depth, both of which are difficult to represent faithfully in numerical simulations.\n  In this work, we review theoretical predictions for the behavior of a simple horizontal dipole above a dielectric half-space, representing the lunar regolith, and compare them with simulation results obtained using the Ansys HFSS integral equation solver. We quantify how the antenna impedance and beam pattern couple to the sky for a representative lunar surface radio astronomy experiment. The results show that surface induced effects decrease rapidly, even for modest increases in antenna height above the regolith. Conversely, a dipole antenna placed on or very near the lunar surface will exhibit complex spectral response that renders systematics control very difficult without detailed information on regolith properties."}

In this work, we extend the so-called \"breaking-the-chains\" model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering \"rattles\" the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown."}

For haloes defined by the ROCKSTAR $M_{200\\mathrm{b}}$ criterion, the classification network demonstrated stable performance across multiple simulation resolutions. For the highest resolution, it achieved over $98\\%$ across all primary performance metrics when identifying halo particles.

Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\\sim 10 \\times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems."}

They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfvén mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight."}

The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT."}

Stevenson"], "title": "Formation of Water-rich Giant Planet Satellites at Decretion Disk Ice Lines", "comment": null, "summary": "The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product."}

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account."}

This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z>4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2\") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission \"escape channels\" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution."}

The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI."}

Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites."}

Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $μ$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $μ$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$α$/H$α$ and Pa$β$/H$α$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions."}

These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \\pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \\pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique."}

We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries.

These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\\rm cyc}$-$P_{\\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables."}

Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$ν$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$ν$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$ν$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$ν$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$ν$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$ν$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $ρ\\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $ρ\\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate.

Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.\n  Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate.

The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\\sim 80\\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\\rm θ_{c} \\sim 3.8^\\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\\rm θ_{w} \\sim 4.4^\\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\\sim 0.72\\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A."}

Chapter written for the the workshop 'Exocomets: Bridging our Understanding of Minor Bodies in Solar and Exoplanetary Systems' (July 2024), at the International Space Science Insitute (ISSI), Bern", "summary": "Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.\n  This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $β$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $β$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars."}

High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time--frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of ~4--5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that."}

Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $γ$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $γ$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\\sim$20\\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $γ$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\\sim$$60\\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $γ$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources."}

By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\\geq 0.33(\\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\\geq 0.24(\\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\\lesssim M\\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys."}

This paper is based on a talk presented at the 87th Fujihara Seminar: The 50th Anniversary Workshop of the Disk Instability Model in Compact Binary Stars, held on 22-26 September 2025 in Tomakomai, Japan. To be published in the Proceedings of Science https://pos.sissa.it/493/", "summary": "WZ Sge-type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae characterised by very rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts. Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions -- such as surface density and effective temperature -- remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$~5$\\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation."}

We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations."}

We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting."}

In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars."}

If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar--Friedman--Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations."}

The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr."}

When accounting for our present uncertainty on the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum through baryon feedback, we find that the error on the composite parameter $S_8=σ_8\\sqrt{Ω_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ almost doubles compared to an LSST analysis which neglects this astrophysical phenomenon. After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative. With tight priors on both these systematic terms, we forecast that LSST cosmic shear can deliver constraints on $S_8$ that are more than five times as constraining as existing cosmic shear surveys."}

The paper is 18 pages long with 16 figures", "summary": "We present results from coordinated multiwavelength observations of the SS 433, obtained with XRISM, optical telescopes, and near-infrared camera during 2024 April and 2025 March. The XRISM exposures amounted to ~200 ks in 2024 and ~100 ks in 2025. With XRISM/Resolve's high spectral resolution and large effective area, we clearly resolved numerous emission lines even in short time segments, achieving improved accuracy in Doppler-shift measurements relative to earlier observations. The simultaneously obtained X-ray and optical Doppler shifts suggest a possible tendency for the optical emission to lag slightly behind the X-rays. In the Resolve data, the Doppler shifts of the two jet components exhibited apparent asymmetries, with jet speeds fluctuating around ~0.26$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2024 and ~0.30$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2025. The velocity variations indicated modulations on a timescale of ~6.3 d, with a phase offset of about -90$^{\\circ}$ relative to the nutation cycle. The observed line widths and flux of the approaching and receding jets appear consistent with the expected geometrical effects, indicating systematically larger line widths in the inner regions of the jets, as proposed by Shidatsu et al. (2025). Optical light curves show flares of ~400 s in 2024 and ~1600 s in 2025, with amplitudes up to ~15% during out-of-eclipse intervals, while the XRISM/Xtend light curves show no significant variability within the overlapping intervals and given the statistical uncertainties. Near-infrared photometry in 2024, obtained during an out-of-eclipse interval at a different epoch from the optical observations, showed no flare-like variability, and the X-ray band also remained constant within uncertainties. These coordinated observations provide a foundation for future XRISM studies aimed at probing the dynamical properties of the relativistic jets in SS 433."}

In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately.

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}

Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor."}

Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing."}

We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc. We find generically that the MOND models massively overproduce large-scale structures by $z=0$, with a most massive cluster in $ν$HDM of $\\approx 5 \\times 10^{17} M_{\\odot}/h$ and typical peculiar velocities of several thousand km/s. We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed \"Local Hole'' do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $<-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $Λ$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $ν$HDM at $>5σ$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $Λ$CDM than is provided by the $ν$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law."}

We simulate different physical polarization sources: Faraday simple, Burn slab, internal turbulence, external turbulence, and two-component models in the POSSUM frequencies, and assess their observational degeneracies and fit accuracies. Our results highlight the model-dependent nature of reliable fitting and identify specific regions of parameter space where model selection, and therefore characterization of the physical medium, becomes ambiguous.

We provide empirical relationships to delineate the boundaries where model distinguishability is impossible.

We investigate whether the late-time radio rebrightening of the nuclear transient IGR J12580+0134 in NGC 4845 can be explained as a repeating pTDE, using multi-epoch Karl G. Jansky VLA observations together with X-ray constraints from Swift/XRT and NICER. The radio light curves show two distinct episodes, with the L-band peaks separated by $\\approx1513$ days. Modeling the second episode with a synchrotron afterglow framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting favors a non-relativistic outflow $v\\simeq0.03c$, with an isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of order $10^{50}$ erg propagating in an approximately constant-density circumnuclear medium. No significant contemporaneous brightening is detected by Swift/XRT during the 2016 radio flare, while faint NICER flares in 2023 suggest intermittent low-level accretion. The recurrence timescale and radio energetics therefore make IGR J12580+0134 a possible candidate for a repeating pTDE system, motivating continued sensitive radio and X-ray monitoring to test future reactivations."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with \"cored\" and \"cuspy\" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time."}

The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT."}

Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor."}

Accepted for Publication in PASA", "summary": "It has been 10 years since the initial discovery of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster and the revelation that large, low surface brightness galaxies may constitute a greater fraction of galaxies than first thought. This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research."}

As a result, the usual ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation may not be applicable. In this Letter, we report on the first fully kinetic simulations of the accretion process where the plasma initially has finite angular momentum. The simulated accretion flow behaves remarkably similarly to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime of ideal MHD, reproducing episodes of magnetic flux saturation and eruption typical of MADs. The resemblance to fluid models owes largely to kinetic instabilities, which regulate pressure anisotropy in the disk, allowing fluid terms to dominate the angular momentum transfer. In addition, by handling vacuum regions effectively, our kinetic approach probes the matter supply to the jet funnel. We observe no efficient penetration of the accreting material into this region, which suggests that a pair discharge may be required to sustain the Blandford-Znajek process."}

The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT."}

We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening.

In fitting a joint SFR-$\\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\\rm {Δlog(SFR_{Hα})}/{Δlog(M_*/M_\\odot)}=1.01\\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs."}

Expanding this catalogue is not only a necessity to facilitate further detailed dust studies beyond the few limited studies conducted thus far, but also to improve pair-to-pair variance and support automated identification through machine learning techniques. To achieve this, we utilise galaxies classified as \"overlapping\" from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD-1, -2, and -5), along with images from Data Release 10 (DR10) of the DESI Legacy Survey, in our individual citizen science project to classify these pairs directly using volunteers. This new catalogue will not only provide a wealth of targets for future dust studies but will also contribute to a deeper understanding of these pairs and dust as a whole."}

However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution."}

Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$α$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region.

These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \\pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \\pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique."}

The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018.

Using both MHD simulations and synthetic turbulence spectra, we explore the spectrum of observed polarization directions measured at a single frequency as a diagnostic for recovering the statistics of turbulence in both the emitting region and the Faraday-rotation screen. We compare these results with our analytical expectations. We also compare the spectrum of polarization direction (SPD) with the wavelength-derivative diagnostic introduced and analytically explored by Lazarian \\& Pogosyan. We demonstrate that the SPD exhibits greater sensitivity to turbulence in the Faraday screen. We provide an observer-friendly criterion to determine whether the SPD samples turbulence in the synchrotron-emitting region or in the Faraday screen. These results open a practical pathway for extracting turbulence statistics from existing and forthcoming single-band radio polarimetry."}

The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset.

Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\\sim 10^9\\rm\\ M_{\\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch.

We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($Σ_{\\rm gas} \\gtrsim 30\\rm\\ M_\\odot \\rm\\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems.

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor."}

Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars."}

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}

Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\\pm12$ pc for the $σ$ Orionis region, $388.5\\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($Δ\\varpi=-0.02\\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions."}

At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfvén modes transform into kinetic-Alfvén or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfvén modes, which transform into pure Alfvén modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfvén modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations."}
