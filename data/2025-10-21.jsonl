We introduce USMILE Avocado, a spectral\nclassification framework that uses broadband photometry from wide-field surveys\n-- Rubin Observatory LSST Data Preview 1, VISTA Hemisphere Survey, and CatWISE\n-- as input features. The framework has two gradient-boosted decision-tree\nmodels scalable to the massive data volumes of modern surveys: the classifier,\nwhich distinguishes ultracool dwarfs from stellar/extragalactic contaminants,\nand the regressor, which predicts spectral types. A key strength is its ability\nto natively handle missing photometric features, whereas earlier\nmachine-learning approaches required complete multi-band detections or relied\non imputation, thereby excluding genuine ultracool dwarfs or introducing bias.\nTrained on an augmented labeled dataset of >2 million sources built from known\nultracool dwarfs, reddened early-type stars, and quasars, the models achieve\nstrong performance: the classifier attains an ROC AUC of 0.976 and an F1 score\nof 0.92, while the regressor yields a mean-squared error of 0.88 subtypes.\nApplying these models, we carried out the first ultracool dwarf search with\nLSST DP1, cross-matched against VHS and CatWISE. Crucially, Euclid Quick Data\nRelease 1 provided near-IR spectra for hundreds of candidates, enabling a rare,\nlarge-scale external spectroscopic validation. This confirmed 15 M6--L2\ndiscoveries, verified USMILE performance, and clarified regimes where USMILE\npredictions are most reliable. Building on these insights, we identified 25\nadditional M6--L9 photometric candidates. These demonstrate the effectiveness\nof machine-learning methods in the data-rich era of wide-field surveys,\nhighlighting the synergy between LSST and Euclid in expanding the ultracool\ndwarf census."}

We\ncalculated the visual Aa-Ab orbit from AstraLux imaging. We detected the SB2\nnature of Aa based on STIS spectra, the companion of the O star (Aa1) being a\nB+B binary (Aa2 = Aa2a + Aa2b). Multiple lines of evidence point towards Aa2\nbeing the EB: time delays in the eclipsing orbit detected by TESS, high mass\nfor Aa2 from SB1 from constraints from the orbit of Aa1, and a lack of\nradial-velocity motion of Ab synchronised with the eclipsing orbit. This\nremains as a tentative conclusion pending further analysis. We detect secular\nchanges in the SB1 orbit of Aa1 on a baseline longer than a century.

The metallicities\nare derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based\noxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines\nare detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between\nz~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times.\nThe FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower\nmetallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained\nby a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies\nas well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all\navailable samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of\nstellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological\nsimulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar\nmasses.

Firstly, we assess the consistency of this compilation with\nCMB-Planck data and recent BAO results from the DESI collaboration.

Our results indicate\nthat combining 2D~BAO with CMB and SNIa data provides observational constraints\nthat are competitive with those obtained using DESI~DR2. Although the precision\nof DESI~DR2 results remains higher, as expected due to the more accurate 3D\nmeasurements, the 2D~BAO compilation yields strong constraints.

After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate\nthrough the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale\ndistributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is\ncontrolled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn\ndepends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave\ndamping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas,\nion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker\nnon-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and\nslower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code\nArepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the\nmultiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion\ncoefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The\nintrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of\nCRs and Alfv\\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show\nthat the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation\nspeed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of\n$10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau\ndamping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those\nincluding both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds\nincrease systematically with gas density, for which we provide a\ndensity-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the\nintrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range\n1{\\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over\ninclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use\naccretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the\nunobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV\ngap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400)\nacross different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray\nluminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of\nthese intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is\ndivided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly\ndifferent values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher\nEddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity\nand accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes\nroughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact\njets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This\nsuggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio\nluminosity in the younger jets.

However, the rarity of transient\nevents and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples\npose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB\nclassification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques,\nwhich inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising\nsolution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point\nsource injection strategies and their effects on classification performance\nwithin a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct\nvarious training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection\n(NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope\nNetwork datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on\nsimulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from\ngravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive\nexperimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus\nfiltering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g.,\nsupernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near\ngalaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a\nhigh false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these\ntrade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate.\nOur results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in\ndeveloping robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up\ncampaigns."}

The main difference between the results of our work and\nthe previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about\n25% smaller.

However, the\nprecise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the\nformation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We\ninvestigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to\nconstrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we\nmodelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy\nmetallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can\ninclude various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in\nthe GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model\nincludes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star\nformation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside\ngalaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to\nobserved LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp\ncutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\\text{O/H}}=12+\\log(\\text{O/H})=8.6\\pm0.1$\n(corresponding to $\\sim0.6Z_{\\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the\nobserved LGRB data. In contrast, a lower threshold proposed in literature (i.e.\nat $Z_{\\text{O/H}}=8.3$ or $\\sim0.3Z_{\\odot}$) fits observations poorly. We\ntherefore conclude that, in contrast to most theoretical LGRB models, a\nrelatively high metallicity threshold at near-solar values provides the best\nmatch between our model and observed LGRBs."}

In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from\nupscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV\nemission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the\nillumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily\ncorrelate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of\nthe series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a\nsample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \\citet{Chen+2025a}. Our\nextensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV\nthat remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim\n10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still\nstatistically significant ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-2}$). These\nfindings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome\nof the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is\nessential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,\nwe report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index\n($\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential\ncompetition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the\n$\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a\nmuch weaker correlation with $\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\\mathrm{null}=2\\times\n10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature.

They are defined as layers where\nthe rotation of the radiative interior transitions to the differential rotation\nof the convective envelope, generating strong shear and turbulence. As such,\nunderstanding the dynamics of the transport and mixing inside stellar\ntachoclines would shed light on how the dynamical processes of the convection\nzone might affect the secular transport of the radiative zone. In particular,\nwe investigate how the change of the latitudinal differential rotation in the\nconvection zone with stellar evolution would affect the dynamics of the\ntachocline. Indeed, as solar-type stars are braked on the Main Sequence, the\ndifferential rotation in the convection zone is expected to evolve from a\ncylindrical rapidly-rotating regime (columns of varying velocities, aligned\nwith the rotation axis) to a conical solar-like regime (with an equatorial\nacceleration as in the case of the Sun) and finally to a conical\nanti-solar-like regime (with a polar acceleration). However, stellar\nevolutionary codes currently only consider at best the solar conical regime to\nstudy the dynamics of stellar tachoclines throughout the evolution of stars. We\ndiscuss different possibilities to model hydrodynamical tachoclines and we show\nthat Mathis Zahn 2004's formalism is able to treat coherently hydrodynamical\nstellar tachoclines when taken in the thin layer approximation. We use it to\nmodel the differential rotation, meridional circulation, and mixing\ncoefficients inside the tachocline in order to examine the effect of the\ndifferent rotation regimes on the transport."}

Here we study the baryonic mass-size relation of\ngalaxies from the SPARC database, using the total baryonic mass ($M_{\\rm bar}$)\nand the baryonic half-mass radius ($R_{\\rm 50, bar}$). We find that SPARC\ngalaxies define two distinct sequences in the $M_{\\rm bar} - R_{\\rm 50, bar}$\nplane: one that formed by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc\ngalaxies, and one by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI\ngalaxies. The $M_{\\rm bar} - R_{\\rm 50, bar}$ relation of LSD galaxies has a\nslope close to 2, pointing to a constant average surface density, whereas that\nof HSD galaxies has a slope close to 1, indicating that less massive spirals\nare progressively more compact. Our results point to the existence of two types\nof star-forming galaxies that follow different evolutionary paths: HSD disks\nare very efficient in converting gas into stars, perhaps thanks to the\nefficient formation of non-axisymmetric structures (bars and spiral arms),\nwhereas LSD disks are not. The HSD-LSD dichotomy is absent in the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation ($M_{\\rm bar}$ versus flat circular velocity $V_{\\rm f}$)\nbut moderately seen in the angular-momentum relation (approximately $M_{\\rm\nbar}$ versus $V_{\\rm f}\\times R_{\\rm 50, bar}$), so it is driven by variations\nin $R_{\\rm 50, bar}$ at fixed $M_{\\rm bar}$. This fact suggests that the\nbaryonic mass-size relation is the most effective empirical tool to distinguish\ndifferent galaxy types and study their evolution."}

The sensitive NOEMA imaging at\n1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5\nkpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as\nextended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with\na common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the\ngalaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the\nnucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the\ncentral 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5\"-0.2\"), implying that the starburst is very extended.\nThe combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent\ninteraction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface\nbrightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are\nsimilar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more\nconcentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the\nintegrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an\n$M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\\times10^{11}$ Msun with\n$\\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$.

The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative\ntransfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from\ndifferent tracers."}

In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from\nupscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV\nemission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the\nillumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily\ncorrelate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of\nthe series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a\nsample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \\citet{Chen+2025a}. Our\nextensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV\nthat remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim\n10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still\nstatistically significant ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-2}$). These\nfindings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome\nof the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is\nessential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,\nwe report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index\n($\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential\ncompetition between the warm and hot coronae.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

Subsequently, we\ncombine our abundances with those from our previous work to measure\npopulation-level average elemental abundances. We find super-solar carbon and\noxygen for this stellar population, indicating that the protoplanetary disks\naround these stars were potentially rich in volatiles. We compare stellar C/O\nto those of their companions, revealing super-stellar C/O for several objects\nthat suggest planet-like formation mechanisms. We also compare the C/O of our\ndirectly imaged companion host star population with other planet host stars\nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, which indicates insufficient evidence to\ndifferentiate between the various stellar populations"}

This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground\nspectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component\nseparation methods. Applying this technique, we derive a new constraint on the\nspectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey\n11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data at K and\nKa bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data.

After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate\nthrough the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale\ndistributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is\ncontrolled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn\ndepends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave\ndamping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas,\nion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker\nnon-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and\nslower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code\nArepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the\nmultiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion\ncoefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The\nintrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of\nCRs and Alfv\\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show\nthat the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation\nspeed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of\n$10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau\ndamping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those\nincluding both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds\nincrease systematically with gas density, for which we provide a\ndensity-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate\nthat, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the\ngalactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local\nAlfv\\'en speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the\ngalaxy."}

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

Expecting a high frequency of\nbreakouts within circumstellar material (CSM), we have produced an extended,\nregular and cubic grid of models covering from low- to high-energy explosions,\ncompact to extended CSM, moderate- to high-density CSM. Here, we document the\nmain results from the radiation-hydrodynamics and nonlocal thermodynamic\nequilibrium radiative-transfer calculations over the first 15d of evolution,\nincluding the bolometric and multi-band light curves and the salient features\nfrom spectra. As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness\nand shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen\nwith OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions\nin a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in\nline profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during\nthe IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately\nafter shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such\nas HeII4686A or CIV5805A. This treasury of models will be used to analyze as\nwell as predict future observations of RSG shock breakouts in CSM."}
