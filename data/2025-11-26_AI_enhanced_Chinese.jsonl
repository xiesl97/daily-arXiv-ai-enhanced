Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u7206\u70b8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35LLM\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u63d0\u51faLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5355LLM\u8c03\u7528+BFS\uff0c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e>0.90\uff09\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\uff08\u65e0LLM\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b>100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u81f34B\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728MetaQA\u4e0a\uff0cgrounded\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u4e8eungrounded\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8df3KG\u95ee\u7b54\u8def\u5f84\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u6602\u8d35\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31 grounding\u3002", "method": "1.

In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care.

Such heterogeneity often manifests as asynchronous signals, imbalanced information between modalities, and interference from task-irrelevant noise, hindering the learning of robust and accurate sentiment representations. To address these issues, we propose a factorized multimodal fusion framework that first disentangles each modality into shared and unique representations, and then suppresses task-irrelevant noise within both to retain only sentiment-critical representations. This fine-grained decomposition improves representation quality by reducing redundancy, prompting cross-modal complementarity, and isolating task-relevant sentiment cues. Rather than manipulating the feature space directly, we adopt a mutual information-based optimization strategy to guide the factorization process in a more stable and principled manner. To further support feature extraction and long-term temporal modeling, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a Mixture of Q-Formers, placed before factorization, which precedes the factorization and uses learnable queries to extract fine-grained affective features from multiple modalities, and a Dynamic Contrastive Queue, placed after factorization, which stores latest high-level representations for contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture long-range discriminative patterns and improve class-level separability.

Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent.

Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\\% accuracy in the top 1\\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\\% asym), and gets 99.8\\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u903c\u8fd1\u5bf9\u90e8\u7f72\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u5927\uff1a\u9006\u66f2\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4f7f\u9759\u6001\u903c\u8fd1\u5931\u6548\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u843d\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u6846\u67b6\uff08SG-OIF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1a(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673aRichardson\u548c\u9884\u6761\u4ef6Neumann\u7ef4\u62a4\u8f7b\u91cf\u951a\u70b9IHVP\uff1b(ii) \u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5982CIFAR-10\uff0820%\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u566a\u58f0\uff09top 1%\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c91.1%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cMNIST 99.8% AUPR\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SG-OIF\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5357\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u6587\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738766%\uff0c\u4ec534%\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301AI\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u516c\u76ca\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8425\u9500\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u8bcd\u8bed\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5728SAfriSenti\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u3001Sepedi\u548cSetswana\u63a8\u6587\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed66%\u3001Sepedi 69%\u3001Setswana 63%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec534%\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "SATA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DeMoE\u548cTaMOT\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5353\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSATA\u6846\u67b6\uff1aDeMoE\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\uff1bTaMOT\u7ba1\u9053\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u5e26\u6821\u51c6ID\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96c6\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.\n  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRaM\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\uff08OnP\uff09\u548c\u51683D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08EnP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u89e3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u566a\u548c\u6709\u566a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u89e3\u7279\u522b\u662fOnP\u6709\u566a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u7387\u77e9\u9635\uff08DRaM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u65e0\u8bef\u5deeEnP\u548cOnP\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u566a\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83SVD\u3001 \u56db\u5143\u6570\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9bEnP\u548cOnP\u65b0\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793aDRaM\u5bb6\u65cf\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230N\u7ef4\u6b27\u6c0f\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5448\u73b03D/2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u89e3\u53ca\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eafGauss\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002"}}

While automatic 3D generation, such as image-to-3d, has made significant strides in recent years, it often struggles to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce LatentDreamer, a novel framework for generating 3D objects from single images. The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models.

Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $\u03c9$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds.

Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoPrune\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\u7684VLMs\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7eRank\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548cFFN\u4f4e\u79e9\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eFLOP\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u89c4\u6a21\u5de8\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5f15\u5165entropy-based eRank\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u5934\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3-based\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548ctraining-free FFN\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u79e9\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQAv2\u3001TextVQA\u3001GQA\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.2x FLOP\u51cf\u5c11\u30011.8x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoPrune\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6709\u6548VLMs\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection.

To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings.

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries.

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u867d\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5982\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u4f4e\u79e9\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSA\uff08Sparse Sparse Attention\uff09\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7a00\u758f/\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u5747\u8fbeSOTA\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u591atoken\u5173\u6ce8\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u672c\u5730\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u5584\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\uff0cSSA\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "SSA\u514b\u670d\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd tradeoff\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08STG\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08Video QA\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165VUE-STG\u548cVUE-TR-V2\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aGemini 3 Pro\u548cGPT-5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e3b\u8981\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002Vidi\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5411\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u5982\u60c5\u8282\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5207\u6362\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6STG\u548cVideo QA\u3002", "method": "Vidi2\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aefSTG\uff08\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Video QA\u3002\u5f15\u5165VUE-STG\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6539\u8fdbvIoU/tIoU\u6307\u6807\uff09\u548c\u5347\u7ea7VUE-TR-V2\u3002", "result": "Vidi2\u5728VUE-TR-V2\u548cVUE-STG\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8aGemini 3 Pro\u53caGPT-5\uff0c\u5728Video QA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidi2\u5c55\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347STG\u548cTR\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Experiments on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our method achieves a superior F1 score of 69.60% while avoiding the complexity of model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MDD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ASR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728L2-ARCTIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe69.60%\u3002", "motivation": "MDD\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6cbb\u7597\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u97f3\u7d20\u7279\u5b9a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728L2-ARCTIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b069.60%\u7684\u4f18\u5f02F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u53d1\u97f3\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages.

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems.

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements.

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios.

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase.

To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small.

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMSVQ-VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u6b63\u5e38WCE\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCDS\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "WCE\u56fe\u50cf\u6d77\u91cf\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u7b5b\u9009\u8017\u65f6\uff1bCDS\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff1b\u73b0\u6709GAN/VAE\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MSVQ-VAE\uff09\uff1b\u65e0\u7f1d\u5c06\u606f\u8089\u3001\u8840\u7ba1\u3001\u708e\u75c7\u7b49\u5f02\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5e38WCE\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CDS\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u4ec5\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance.

We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings.

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecSES\u3001MPD\u548cANLD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff08BNLTK\uff09\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\uff08Snowball\uff09\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u867dSES\u9ad8\u4f46\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aSES\uff08\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff09\u3001MPD\uff08\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u548cANLD\uff08\u8bcd\u5e72\u8bcd\u4e0e\u539f\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Levenshtein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bedBNLTK\u548c\u82f1\u8bedSnowball\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u6700\u9ad8\uff081.67\uff0cCR=1.90\uff09\uff0c\u4f46ANLD\u4f4e\uff080.26\uff09\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u9002\u4e2d\uff081.31\uff09\uff0cANLD=0.14\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u6548\u7387\u6536\u76ca\uff08\u9ad8SES\uff09\u548c\u542b\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\uff08\u4f4eANLD\uff09\uff0c\u82f1\u8bedSnowball\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation.

However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement).

Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u653e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6216\u5f3aLLM\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cdLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08GE-consistency\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u5f3aLLM\u504f\u597doracle\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "AlignEval\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6392\u540dLLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aAlpacaEval\u548cArena-Hard\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793aLLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics.

By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u5fae\u6279\u6b21\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4e0a\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famin-STP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5fae\u6270\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5fae\u6279\u6b21min-STP\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5207\u7247\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u4e00-shot\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6d41\u57fa\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u644a\u9500\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fbmin-STP\u63d0\u5347OT\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05).

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%).

In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVESSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff08SSL\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff1bVLMs\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u589e\u5f3aSSL\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9636\u6bb51\uff0c\u7528\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u677f\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3VESSA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8SAM2\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u9636\u6bb52\uff0c\u5c06VESSA\u96c6\u6210\u5230SOTA SSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\uff0cVESSA\u589e\u5f3aSSL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "VESSA\u6709\u6548\u5c06VLM\u80fd\u529b\u878d\u5165SSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression.

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute.

From Analysis to Path Forward", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc6\u522bRoPE\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387DiT\u53bb\u566a\u65f6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5d29\u6e83\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CRPA\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u76f8\u4f4d\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "DiT\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53bb\u566a\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u683c\u4ee4\u724c\u6df7\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4RoPE\u76f8\u4f4d\u6df7\u53e0\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u76f8\u4f4d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c16\u9510\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "CRPA\u4fee\u6539RoPE\u7d22\u5f15\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709Q/K\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f6e\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u6b65\u5e45\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b49\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u540c\u76f8\u4f4d\u589e\u91cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u6240\u6709\u5934\u5c42\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "CRPA\u4ece\u6e90\u5934\u6d88\u9664\u7ed3\u6784\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u63a2\u9488\uff08LRP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488VLMs\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347STVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5982\u8bef\u8bfb\u201c50 mph\u201d\u4e3a\u201c60 mph\u201d\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5168\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u62fc\u63a5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9token\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u3001\u5355\u5c42\u63a2\u9488\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53477.6%\uff1b\u63a2\u9488\u6cdb\u5316\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks.

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions.

In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a \"warmup-align\" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer.

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%).

For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects.

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Motion Marionette\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u7edf\u4e003D\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2. \u4ece\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a(SpaT)\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3. \u5c06SpaT\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u6574\u5408\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(PBD)\u7cbe\u70bc\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6e90\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Motion Marionette\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content.

To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues.

However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines.

However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens.

However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively.

Romero", "Ming-Yu Liu", "Yongxin Chen"], "title": "MFM-point: Multi-scale Flow Matching for Point Cloud Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions.

To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration.

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGGT4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398VGGT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "4D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u79bb\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\uff1b3D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bVGGT\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u73b0\u67094D\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u6316\u6398VGGT\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gram\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u653e\u5927\u5e76\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u805a\u5408\u83b7\u5f97\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u7cbe\u70bc\u63a9\u7801\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u5230VGGT\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a20\u5bc6\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8fc7500\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "VGGT4D\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u76844D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene.

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art.

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency.

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline.

Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step.

Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy.

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance.

Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics.

To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block.

In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function.

Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks.

However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \\textit{in vivo} CEST scans.

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset.

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety.

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method.

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor.

Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting.

Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression.

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path.

This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50MLLMs\u7684CVIT\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CVIT\u5ffd\u7565\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u548c\u8c10\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "HPA\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7126\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u533a\u3001\u548c\u8c10\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CVIT\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHPA\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "HPA\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50MLLMs\u7684CVIT\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

Imran Cheema"], "title": "HistoSpeckle-Net: Mutual Information-Guided Deep Learning for high-fidelity reconstruction of complex OrganAMNIST images via perturbed Multimode Fibers", "comment": null, "summary": "Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images.

However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation.

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization.

However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space.

The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods.

First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency.

However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTReFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fRectified Flow (RF)\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RF\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9700\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\uff1bCycleGAN-Turbo\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eRF\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e00\u6b65\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "TReFT\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT/UNet\u9884\u6d4b\u7684velocity\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u672b\u671fvelocity\u6536\u655b\u5230\u539f\u70b9\u5230\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u67b6\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728SD3.5\u3001FLUX\u7b49\u5927RF\u6a21\u578b\u4e0afinetune\u540e\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eSOTA\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TReFT\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9a6f\u670dRF\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer.

This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements.

Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090.

Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \\times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \\times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) \u63a8\u7406\u6162\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa FREE \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9876\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u884c\u62bd\u6837\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "DiTs \u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cfSOTA\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DiTs\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u8349\u7a3f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u540e\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u964d\u4f4e\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790DiT\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9876\u5c42transformer\u5757\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\uff1b\u63d0\u51faFREE\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cfdrafter\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52+\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff1bFREE(relax)\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-512\u00b2\u4e0a\uff0cFREE\u8fbe1.86\u00d7\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFREE(relax)\u8fbe2.25\u00d7\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FREE\u548cFREE(relax)\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fDiT\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMultiID\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591aID\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u5355ID\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ID\u89e3\u8026\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53calocal prompt\u3001depth-guided spatial control\u3001extended self-attention\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3copy-paste\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728IDBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\u9762\u4e34copy-paste\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u5dee\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591aID\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5355ID\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u7528\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u914d\u591aID\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5355ID\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5e94\uff1aID-decoupled cross-attention\u6ce8\u5165\u5404ID embedding\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u533a\u57df\uff1blocal prompt\u3001depth-guided spatial control\u3001extended self-attention\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6784\u5efaIDBench\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMultiID\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u591aID\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiID\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591aID\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin.

To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner.

In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals.

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks.

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain.

However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image.

MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision.

We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs.

However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan).

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data.

To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance.

In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition.

Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models.

This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information.

However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space.

We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions.

We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies.

Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/LocateAnything3D/", "summary": "To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes.

We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u221e-RoPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Block-Relativistic RoPE\u3001KV Flush\u548cRoPE Cut\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u754c\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\u6162\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7535\u5f71\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\uff1a(i) 3D-RoPE\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u754c\uff1b(ii) \u957f\u5e8f\u5217 rollout \u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\u6162\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff1b(iii) \u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7535\u5f71\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "method": "\u221e-RoPE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1aBlock-Relativistic RoPE\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u65b0\u5757\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u89c6\u754c\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u65e9\u5757\u5411\u540e\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9650\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff1bKV Flush\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40sink\u548c\u6700\u540e\u5e27\u66f4\u65b0KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5373\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\uff1bRoPE Cut\uff08\u5f15\u5165RoPE\u5750\u6807\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6d41\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u6e21\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u221e-RoPE\u5728VBench\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u221e-RoPE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u89c6\u754c\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u3002"}}

A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "RubricRL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684RL\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6807\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2aprompt\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u51c6\u68c0\u67e5\u8868\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u3001OCR\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6001judge\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528prompt\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eGRPO\u6216PPO\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347prompt\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RubricRL\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caRL\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
