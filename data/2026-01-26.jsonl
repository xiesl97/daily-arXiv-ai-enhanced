This rapid variability provides the opportunity to quantify intrinsic variability and separate time-variable emission features from stable signatures of strong gravity and the accretion environment. To infer the properties \\sgra and its surrounding accretion flow, we perform Bayesian inference on a series of EHT data segments (``snapshots''). We directly fit parameters of a semi-analytic emission model jointly with complex station gains to snapshot visibilities, then extract estimates of the time-averaged, persistent source structure and temporal variability by stacking snapshots in a Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach successfully reproduces parameters of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulations using synthetic EHT observations. Even with physically motivated assumptions about the \\sgra environment, black hole spin and magnetic field parameters are poorly constrained by 2017 EHT observations. Our inference constrains other parameters, favoring a nearly face-on observer inclination ($θ_{\\rm o} = 9.2\\degree \\pm 3.6 \\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 11.6\\degree$), an emission peak near the horizon ($R_{\\rm peak} = 4.9 \\pm 0.1 \\pm_{\\rm v} 0.5\\,GM/c^2$), near-vertical projected spin position angle ($p.a. = 7.3\\degree \\pm 7.08 \\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 43.5\\degree$ counterclockwise from vertical), and dominant emission $43.4\\degree \\pm 2.0\\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 5.9\\degree$ above the equatorial plane, where we separate average structure uncertainty ($\\pm$) from the impacts of temporal variability and model misspecification ($\\pm_{\\rm v}$)."}

We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries."}

It successfully operated for over four years until June 2025 when it de-orbited. VZLUSAT-2 was a 3U CubeSat launched in January 2022 to a 535 km altitude polar orbit and de-orbited in November 2025 after almost four years of smooth operation. It carried on board two GRB detectors very similar to the one used on GRBAlpha. Both missions have detected about 360 gamma-ray transients, including over 170 long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and including the most intense GRB ever recorded GRB 221009A and the second brightest GRB 230307A. The new family member, GRBBeta 2U CubeSat, integrated at Masaryk University, was launched in July 2024 to a 580 km altitude, 62 degree inclination orbit. It has been detecting GRBs since its launch without any trouble. Gamma-ray detectors on these nanosatellites are based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). These missions also provide a unique opportunity to study the radiation damage of SiPMs in the low Earth orbit environment and monitor the radiation belts. We have demonstrated that CubeSats can be used in missions lasting beyond three years and routinely detect GRBs."}

We adopt an agnostic approach, using transition energy density, transition pressure, the discontinuity strength, and a constant speed of sound for quark matter as our parameter space to construct a large possibility of hybrid equations of state, and thereby encapsulating a comprehensive picture of the twin star scenario. First, we report the complete conditions on our parameter space imposed by the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium solutions. For a fixed transition energy density and speed of sound for quark matter, we define distinct ranges of transition pressures based on the allowed strengths of discontinuity. Below a maximum transition pressure, a range of discontinuity exists that increases as the transition pressure decreases. Thereby, we identify the loci of the limits on discontinuities as the `witch-hat' curves. Based on the causality limit, the witch-hat curves can be punctured or incomplete. Strong constraints on this picture are drawn from the inferences from GW170817 and the NICER measurements. We computed the maximum mass for twin stars to be $2.05~M_\\odot$, the allowed strongest discontinuity in rest-mass density to be $7.76ρ_\\mathrm{sat}$, and the upper bound on transition rest-mass density to be $4.03ρ_\\mathrm{sat}$. Subsequently, we compute the implications of the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state on this picture. Different confidence levels for observational inferences are considered to assess the extent of inclusion (and rejection) of hybrid equations of state and, consequently, their effects on the limits of the maximum mass of twin stars and phase transition properties."}

Among dynamical effects other than direct gravitational interactions, primary tides and gas drag cause the secondary's semi-major axis to evolve secularly. The consequences of these two effects on the mean ratios of secondary orbital distances are assessed for the four systems. A general relation is first derived to estimate a past initial mean distance ratio and is characterised for primary tides and for the drag caused by primordial nebulae. Results show first that the mean distance ratios of the four systems did not evolve sensibly under primary tidal action for periods corresponding to the age of the Solar System, and that the mean distance ratios are approximately conserved after the dissipation of initial nebulae. Secondly, the mean distance ratios may not have changed much due to gas drag caused by primaeval nebulae after formation of initial proto-secondaries and for periods corresponding to assumed lifetimes of nebulae, depending on initial nebulae models and on periods of effective drag. These results involve only the systems' mean distance ratios and do not imply that neither the secondary distances nor the individual distance ratios are conserved. Resonances among secondaries mean motions would reinforce the approximate conservation of mean distance ratios."}

Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \\pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \\pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \\simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \\pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies."}

By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way."}

Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $α\\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales."}

We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (<100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1<z<4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z>1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun.

With a likely orbital period of 1.164 d or 2.327 d, the origin of the SSS component is controversial, with the two current models being either steady He-burning on the white dwarf surface, or that it is a helium nova in the decaying phase. To help resolve this issue we present extensive new long-term spectroscopy (with SALT) and photometry (at SAAO and with OGLE) of [HP99] 159 which (a) supports 2.327 d as the orbital period, and (b) finds only a small He II radial velocity modulation. The latter is surprising as it implies a very low inclination system, whereas our light curve modelling suggests $i{\\sim}50^\\circ$, and hence that the He II must be produced in outflowing material further above, or beyond, the disc. We find that the decaying nova model cannot fit our OGLE light curve and the observed SSS flux level. [HP99] 159 has been essentially constant as an SSS over several decades, implying a sustained high level of mass-transfer from its He star donor, making it the only confirmed single-degenerate scenario SN Ia progenitor. We have updated the known SSS binary parameters and find a clear $\\sim$1.5 mag difference in their $M_{\\rm V}$ when compared to the $M_{\\rm V} - Σ$ properties of LMXBs, likely due to the larger irradiated areas and more luminous donors."}

While the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will transform Solar System science, its observing cadence and survey design were not specifically optimized to discover imminent impactors. To assess its performance, we introduce a new method for efficiently generating synthetic impactor populations by minimally perturbing sampled NEOMOD3 orbits and evaluate their discovery efficiency with the Sorcha survey simulator. Our simulations show that LSST discovers 79.7% of large impactors (>140 m), decreasing to 50.3% for upper mid-sized (50-140 m), 26.8% for lower mid-sized (20 - 50 m), and 10.5% for small objects (10-20 m). Warning times of the discovered impactors show a similar size dependence: small objects are typically discovered only weeks before impact (median:12.4 days), lower mid-sized within a month (median: 21.5 days), and upper mid-sized objects on timescales of a few months (median: 106.2 days). 39.0% of large impactors are discovered more than a year before impact, lacking long-lead warning despite their brightness. A loss-mode analysis reveals the underlying cause that small impactors are limited mainly by photometric sensitivity, whereas mid-sized and large objects are missed primarily due to cadence and linking constraints from LSST and its Solar System Processing (SSP) Pipelines. These results show that LSST excels at discovering faint, small impactors, but cannot by itself guarantee long-lead warning across the hazardous size spectrum. Coordinated multi-survey strategies will therefore be essential in the LSST era to achieve robust planetary-defense capability, and we study a complementary high-cadence, shallow-depth example with the Argus Array."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

We build population-level toy models using \\texttt{fsps} to help interpret our observations, and find that scatter in \\rline\\ primarily reflects the amplitude of SFH fluctuations; this implies that our observed lack of evolution in the scatter of \\rline\\ is due to similar star formation burstiness from $z\\sim3$ to $z\\sim7$. Our observations are best reproduced by a set of SFHs with rising, long-duration, and large-amplitude bursts. Finally, we demonstrate that the toy model that best describes our $z\\sim6$ data can boost UV brightness by up to $ΔM_{\\rm UV}\\sim-2.0\\,{\\rm mag}$ compared with a 200\\,Myr constant SFH, and naturally produces a large number of galaxies at $z>10$.

TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today."}

Among known young stellar objects (YSOs), those exhibiting the most dramatic increases in brightness due to sudden increase in mass accretion rate are eruptive young stars. Gaia20dsk is one of the Gaia-alerted young star candidates that has displayed a double, nonperiodic brightening resembling that of other young eruptive stars.\n  Aims. The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star.\n  Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum. In our analysis, we examined the optical and IR light curves from the bursts, reviewing the color-magnitude diagrams across different bands, reporting the detection of emission lines, and providing estimates of the star's accretion rates during the burst.\n  Results. The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of ~1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects. The mass accretion rate is between (0.5-1.8)*10^{-6} M_sun/yr.\n  Conclusions. Gaia20dsk is an eruptive YSO that exhibits photometric features similar to those of MNors, including its characteristic brightening amplitude and burst duration, along with similar spectroscopic features and accretion rates."}

The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii.\n  We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other.\n  To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables."}

This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$μ$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1<z<4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation."}

All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$χ$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$χ$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process.

Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $α=-1.08\\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst."}

In this work, we identify six new CBO candidates, designated ZTF-CBO-1 through ZTF-CBO-6, through a systematic search of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometry. These systems exhibit deep ($\\gtrsim$1 mag) periodic dimming events with orbital periods ranging from $\\sim$30 to $\\sim$530 days and occultation durations spanning 32%-77% of their orbital periods. Such large duty cycles rule out the interpretation of circum-companion material occultation. Spectral energy distributions of ZTF-CBO-1 and ZTF-CBO-2 reveal infrared excess indicative of a dust component. TESS observations of ZTF-CBO-1 show no hours- to days-timescale variability during ingress and egress, indicating a smooth disk edge. These discoveries nearly double the known CBO sample, enabling meaningful population-level studies."}

This discrepancy may be due to observational biases in bar detectability when comparing simulations with observations. We present a proof-of-concept study quantifying how Euclid-like observational conditions affect bar detectability in TNG50. We analysed the entire galaxy sample at $z = 0.5$ and highlight one borderline case with a bar length of 2.1 kpc and bar strength $A_2 = 0.4$. Synthetic images were produced with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and realistic post-processing, and analysed with ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition, as well as the recently constructed Zoobot analysis. Results were compared to idealised, noise-free stellar mass maps. In the illustrative case the bar is clearly detected in the mass map and remains visible in the Euclid VIS $I_{\\rm E}$ filter, where Zoobot also classifies it as barred, but becomes undetectable in $Y_{\\rm E}$ and in the VIS-NISP RGB composite, with all methods failing outside VIS. Extending to the full $z = 0.5$ sample, Zoobot recovers only 31/141 galaxies, while $A_2$ and ellipse fitting perform better (80/141 and 67/141) but still miss many short or weak bars. When non-detections are counted as unbarred, the bar fraction of 44 percent falls to $12\\!-\\!33$ percent depending on the method. These results demonstrate the strong impact of observational effects on bar detectability and motivate bar-fraction estimates which incorporate realistic instrumental conditions across redshift in cosmological simulations."}

We conducted a parameter study of 56 3D hydrodynamic simulations of ECSN in ONe white dwarfs using a level set based flame model implemented in the Leafs code. We varied both the ignition location and the central density at ignition to determine the conditions of the transition regime.

From our parameter study, we find a transition density in the range of $\\logρ_c^{ini}=10.0$ and $10.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, depending on the ignition location and utilized laminar flame speed parameterization. Importantly, we find that for sufficiently high central densities, the burned ashes can sink into the core and trap large amounts of neutron-rich material in the bound remnant. In the transition regime between explosion and collapse, we find that the laminar flame speed plays a critical role by suppressing the formation of instabilities and thereby reducing the nuclear energy generation needed to overcome the collapse. We find that a thermonuclear explosion is possible for a wide range of parameters, whereby a more off-center ignition allows for higher central densities to still result in an explosion.

In analogy to what occurs in the case of a homogeneous medium, there exist a family of solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions. A shooting method is employed to isolate those solutions that fulfill a specific set of physical and mathematical constraints. The tail is found to be both densest and slowest when the scaleheight $H$ is equal to the gravitational radius $ξ_{0}\\equiv GM/v_{0}^{2}$, where $v_{0}$ its relative velocity with respect to the medium. The location of the stagnation point is evaluated as a function of $H$ and $ξ_{0}$, and an empirical fitting formula is provided. While the distance to the stagnation point is maximized when $H\\simeq ξ_{0}$, the mass accretion rate attains its maximum value for $H \\ll ξ_{0}$ at fixed surface density. When instead the midplane density is held constant and $H$ is varied, the accretion rate hardly changes once $H$ exceeds about $2ξ_{0}$. Additionally, we investigate how both the drag force resulting from mass accretion and the gravitational drag arising from its tail depend on $H/ξ_{0}$. We highlight how the effect of varying the degree of mixing in the tail influences the resulting drag force. Finally, for the particular case of an infinitely thin layer, we provide a simple analytical solution, which may serve as a useful pedagogical reference."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\\sim 10\\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \\sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters.

We investigate fast magnetoacoustic wave behavior within gravitationally stratified, magnetically inhomogeneous media, by studying a magnetic environment containing a simple 2D X-type magnetic null point. The addition of gravitational stratification fundamentally changes the nature of the system, including breaking the symmetry. There are two main governing effects: the stratified density profile acts in combination with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, creating a large gradient in the Alfven speed and hence a system replete with refraction. The system is investigated using both numerical simulations and a semianalytical WKB solution (via Charpit's method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver) and we find strong agreement between both. The results show a fundamental difference between the stratification-free and stratified cases, including the formation of caustic surfaces and cusps, and we contextualize these results in the theoretical understanding of fast magnetoacoustic waves."}

We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($β$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar."}

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we report the detection of a filament in the Ursa Major supergroup using atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations. This filament consists of sixteen various types of galaxies and five starless gas clumps, spanning a length of approximately 0.9 Mpc. Notably, it is extremely thin, with a thickness comparable to the diameter of a galaxy. We observed a galaxy-filament spin alignment and a velocity gradient within the filament. These findings strongly suggest a cold accretion flow along the filament, potentially contributing to the formation and growth of the galaxies. The thin filament, as a small group, is likely to be merged into the Ursa Major supergroup in the context of hierarchical structure formation."}

By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way."}

However, direct evidence for a hot (million-Kelvin) CGM around present-day L* galaxies remains elusive. Here, we present the first systematic search of the hot CGM around nearby (< 50 Mpc) L* galaxies, by stacking their X-ray images and spectra from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Significant diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~ 50 kpc, with spectral signatures consistent with a hot gas but arguing against a predominantly non-thermal origin. The radial distribution and total amount of the hot gas are in agreement with prediction by IllustrisTNG simulations. The constraints on the hot CGM derived in this study hold promise for calibrating key physical processes in next-generation cosmological simulations."}

Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \\pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \\pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \\simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \\pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies."}

These systems exhibit deep ($\\gtrsim$1 mag) periodic dimming events with orbital periods ranging from $\\sim$30 to $\\sim$530 days and occultation durations spanning 32%-77% of their orbital periods. Such large duty cycles rule out the interpretation of circum-companion material occultation.

Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $α\\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales."}

Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $α$-enhanced ([$α$/Fe]=0.27, $σ$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $α$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\\le$-1.0) or $α$-poor ([Fe/H]$>$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $α$-poor ([$α$/Fe]=-0.01, $σ$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $α$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$α$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples."}

All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$χ$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$χ$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures."}

The high resolving power, R~120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2)~2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b~1.7 km/s) and a broader (b~6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3 ~ 2.8 with temperature of ~40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3 ~ 1.4 , T~600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to ~0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam -- the size of the quasar's accretion disc -- when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources."}

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of numerical simulations of multiphase gas in and around galaxies. We begin by outlining the environments where multiphase gas arises and the physical and computational challenges associated with its modeling. Key quantities that characterize multiphase gas dynamics are discussed, followed by an in-depth look at idealized setups such as turbulent mixing layers, cloud-wind interactions, thermal instability, and turbulent boxes. The review then transitions to less idealized and/or larger-scale simulations, covering radiative supernovae bubbles, tall box simulations, isolated galaxy models including dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems, and cosmological zoom-in simulations, with a particular focus on simulations that enhance resolution in the halo. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of connecting scales, extracting robust diagnostics, and comparing simulations to observations.

We find a critical collapse efficiency, $γ_{\\rm c} \\simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM.

TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today."}

Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it."}

With a likely orbital period of 1.164 d or 2.327 d, the origin of the SSS component is controversial, with the two current models being either steady He-burning on the white dwarf surface, or that it is a helium nova in the decaying phase. To help resolve this issue we present extensive new long-term spectroscopy (with SALT) and photometry (at SAAO and with OGLE) of [HP99] 159 which (a) supports 2.327 d as the orbital period, and (b) finds only a small He II radial velocity modulation. The latter is surprising as it implies a very low inclination system, whereas our light curve modelling suggests $i{\\sim}50^\\circ$, and hence that the He II must be produced in outflowing material further above, or beyond, the disc. We find that the decaying nova model cannot fit our OGLE light curve and the observed SSS flux level. [HP99] 159 has been essentially constant as an SSS over several decades, implying a sustained high level of mass-transfer from its He star donor, making it the only confirmed single-degenerate scenario SN Ia progenitor. We have updated the known SSS binary parameters and find a clear $\\sim$1.5 mag difference in their $M_{\\rm V}$ when compared to the $M_{\\rm V} - Σ$ properties of LMXBs, likely due to the larger irradiated areas and more luminous donors."}

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature."}

Here, I proved that the outer north-eastern region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a relatively recent stellar structure with a tidal origin from the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud, is imprinted by a residual velocity pattern. I obtained from GEMINI GMOS spectra mean radial velocities of star clusters formed in situ, which added to derived mean proper motions and heliocentric distances, allowed to compute their 3D space velocity components. These space velocities differentiate from those that the clusters would have if they instead orderly rotated with the galaxy, i.e., their residual velocities are larger than the upper limit for an object pertaining to the SMC main body rotation disk. The level of kinematic disturbance depends on the SMC rotation disk adopted; galaxy rotation disks traced using relatively old objects are discouraged.The resulting kinematic disturbance arises in younger and older stellar populations, so that the epoch of close interaction between both Magellanic Clouds cannot be uncovered on the basis of the kinematics behavior of stellar populations populating the outer SMC"}

We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \\% (yielding however $w_{\\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $Λ$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $Λ$CDM could only be detected at 1 $σ$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\\sim$ 2 $σ$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $Λ$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $Λ$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target."}

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $fσ_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $γ$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $γ$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $γ$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $γ$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)"}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

We analyze a sample of quasars built upon the Gaia satellite and unWISE data, Quaia, to measure the local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$.

Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 μm}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population.

We use \\texttt{CoLoRe} simulations to create mock DESI 5-year Ly$α$ forests and Rubin Observatory LSST 10-year photometric galaxies up to $z=3$, and measure the galaxy redshift distribution via their angular cross-correlations. Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$α$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$α$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($θ$), and redshift bin size ($Δz$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \\texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $θ\\sim10$ arcmin and $Δz=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24σ$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z<2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $σ_z/(1+\\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\\bar{z}=2$. This demonstrates that Ly$α$ cross-correlation is a reliable and promising method to calibrate the high-redshift tails of photometric Stage IV galaxy surveys."}

This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$μ$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1<z<4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it."}

Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \\pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \\pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \\simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \\pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies."}

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we report the detection of a filament in the Ursa Major supergroup using atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations. This filament consists of sixteen various types of galaxies and five starless gas clumps, spanning a length of approximately 0.9 Mpc. Notably, it is extremely thin, with a thickness comparable to the diameter of a galaxy. We observed a galaxy-filament spin alignment and a velocity gradient within the filament. These findings strongly suggest a cold accretion flow along the filament, potentially contributing to the formation and growth of the galaxies. The thin filament, as a small group, is likely to be merged into the Ursa Major supergroup in the context of hierarchical structure formation."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

The high resolving power, R~120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2)~2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b~1.7 km/s) and a broader (b~6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3 ~ 2.8 with temperature of ~40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3 ~ 1.4 , T~600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to ~0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam -- the size of the quasar's accretion disc -- when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources."}

The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star.\n  Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum.

The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of ~1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects.
